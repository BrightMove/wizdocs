Hi Jimmy,
 
Thanks again for taking the time to walk me through BrightMoveâ€”I appreciated the overview. Iâ€™d like to loop in Laurel Blanco (copied), our Director of Talent Strategy, so she can review the platformâ€™s capabilities as we evaluate a new ATS.
 
Here are a few things top of mind we would likely want to touch on:
 
End-to-end workflow for posting roles, reviewing and sharing resumes with hiring managers, and gathering their feedback
Sourcing capabilitiesâ€”can we import LinkedIn resumes and create candidate profiles?
Any onboarding tools once an offer is accepted?
Resume filtering based on application questions
Run through best ways to capture referrals (50% of our new hires come from referrals)
Examples of company websites currently using BrightMove, so we can experience the candidate-facing side
Tools in place to detect or prevent AI-generated/robotic resumes
Integration with ADP Workforce Nowâ€”how that works (Iâ€™m not especially tech-savvy ðŸ˜Š)
Implementation process & data portability if we choose to offboard
Customer support structure. Would we have a dedicated rep, or is there a general support line?
Any data on customer retention you can share?
 
Laurel is in/out for the next couple of weeks, but Iâ€™d be happy to connect early next week to coordinate a future time for us all to meet. Let me know your availability, and hopefully we can get something scheduled soon.
 
Thanks,
Brett

Hi Jimmy,
 
Iâ€™m on a call that might run over. I wanted to give you a heads up that I will likely be late with the potential of having to reschedule. Would you prefer to reschedule or are you comfortable waiting?

Thanks,
Brett
