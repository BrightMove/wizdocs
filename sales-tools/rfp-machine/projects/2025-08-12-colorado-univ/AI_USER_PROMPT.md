For this project, I want to create a RFP response based on a joint venture with Inovium & BrightMove.  Inovium will be the service delivery partner and BrightMove will be the technology platform vendor.

Rebuild the RFP response with the updated pricing.  Make sure the HTML content preserves the colors and font so a save to PDF is rich in color.

## Stake Holders

# Inovium Team
- Mike Brandt, Head of Alliances, michael.brandt@inovium.com, 305-906-0390, 1005 Contress Ave., Suite 925, Austin, TX 78701

# BrightMove Team
- Jimmy Hurff, Head of Customer Success, jimmy@brightmove.com, 305-602-8998, 320 High Tide Drive, Suite 201, Saint Augustine Beach, FL 32080

## Solution Path

# Key aspects of solution proposal

- Use per worksite employee pricing model only
- Do not propose any add ons or options
- BrightMove has achieved SOC 2 Type I audit.  See https://trust.brightmove.com for more info.
- There are no candidate facing scheduling tools
- There is no standalone mobile app; the site is responsive and mobile friendly for candidates
- Candidates must create an account to apply for jobs
- Sandbox environment available for testing at rate of $100/month.  No staging and production promotion capabilities are available with sandbox; it is a proving ground, not a staging environment.

# Services 

- Implementation services, training, integration with 3rd party systems, branding, marketing are all to be offered on time & material basis in addition to license costs.  Allow Inovium to define these specifics.

## Response Format Requirements

**Requestor Prescribed Format Is Default**: If requestor has supplied forms within the input folder, use them and their prescribed format for the response
- **Copy Files**: Create copies with names based on conventions specified in output folder.  If naming convention isn't specified, use best practices and give sequences that can be inferred from table of contents.
- **Format Guidelines**: Follow format guidelines as stipulated in the requesting documents as the default.
**No Format Prescribed**: If requestor has not supplied forms or prescribed format response, use common theme across all artifacts.
**Table Format**: Every question must follow this exact table structure:
- **Question Column**: The RFP question text
- **Yes/No Column**: Must contain exactly one of these values:
  - "Yes" (green styling) - Feature is available/supported
  - "No" (red styling) - Feature is not available/supported  
  - "-" (neutral styling) - Not applicable or not relevant
- **Response Column**: Detailed explanation expanding on the Yes/No answer with specific feature details, limitations, or implementation notes
- **Copy & Paste Friendly**: Use standard colors and formatting that is easy to copy and past into new documents, like Microsoft Word and Adobe Acrobat

This format ensures clear, scannable responses while providing comprehensive detail for evaluation.
