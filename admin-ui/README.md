## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required Ruby gems:

```bash
cd admin-ui
bundle install
```

If you don't have Bundler installed:
```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### 2. Configure API Credentials

Copy the example configuration file:
```bash
cp config.env.example config.env
```

Edit `config.env` with your API credentials:

```bash
# JIRA Configuration (used for both JIRA and Confluence)
JIRA_SITE=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@domain.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token

# Intercom Configuration
INTERCOM_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-intercom-access-token
INTERCOM_CLIENT_ID=your-intercom-client-id
INTERCOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your-intercom-client-secret

# Application Configuration
PORT=3000
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### 3. Get API Credentials

#### JIRA & Confluence Setup
1. Go to your Atlassian account settings: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Wizdocs Admin UI")
4. Copy the generated token
5. Use your JIRA email address as the username
6. The same credentials work for both JIRA and Confluence APIs

#### Intercom Setup
1. Go to your Intercom developer settings: https://developers.intercom.com/
2. Create a new app or use existing one
3. Generate an access token
4. Copy the token to your config file

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
ruby app.rb
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### Settings
- Configure JIRA, Confluence, and Intercom API credentials
- Test API connections
- Set application preferences
- Monitor connection status

## API Endpoints

### Ticket Management

- `GET /api/tickets/all` - Get all cached tickets
- `GET /api/tickets/search` - Search tickets
- `GET /api/tickets/statistics` - Get ticket statistics
- `GET /api/tickets/sync-status` - Check sync status

### Confluence Integration
- `GET /api/confluence/sync` - Sync all Confluence content
- `GET /api/confluence/content` - Get cached Confluence content
- `GET /api/confluence/spaces` - Get all Confluence spaces
- `GET /api/confluence/search` - Search Confluence content

## Analysis Logic

### Cross-Platform Duplication Detection
- Analyzes content similarity between JIRA tickets and Confluence pages
- Uses keyword-based similarity calculation
- Identifies potential duplications across platforms
- Prioritized as "High" priority for cleanup

### Content Accuracy Analysis
- Checks for outdated content and broken JIRA references
- Identifies content that references non-existent tickets
- Analyzes content age and update patterns
- Prioritized as "Medium" priority

### Orphaned Content Detection
- Finds Confluence content with no related JIRA tickets
- Identifies standalone documentation
- Helps identify content that needs ticket creation
- Prioritized as "Low" priority

### JIRA Ticket Analysis
- Finds tickets that haven't been updated in 6+ months
- Excludes tickets with status "Closed" or "Done"
- Identifies potential duplicates within JIRA
- Provides comprehensive cross-project analysis

## Directory Structure

The Admin UI works with the Wizdocs audit structure:

```
wizdocs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin-ui/          # This application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audits/            # Veracity audit directories
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engage/        # Example audit
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ input/     # Contextually relevant documents
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ output/    # Audit output documents
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other-audits]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/              # Application codebases
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/              # Shared Python virtual environment
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **JIRA/Confluence Connection Failed**
   - Verify your JIRA site URL is correct
   - Check that your API token is valid
   - Ensure your email address matches your Atlassian account

2. **Intercom Connection Failed**
   - Verify your access token is correct
   - Check that your app has the necessary permissions
   - Ensure the token hasn't expired

3. **Gems Not Found**
   - Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
   - Make sure you're using the correct Ruby version

4. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the PORT in config.env
   - Or kill the process using the current port

5. **Cache Issues**
   - Clear the cache directory: `rm -rf cache/*`
   - Restart the application
   - Re-sync your data

### Debug Mode

To run in debug mode with more detailed logging:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development ruby app.rb
```

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `config.env` file to version control
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate your API tokens
- Monitor API usage to stay within rate limits
- Cache files contain sensitive data - secure appropriately

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New API Integration**: Add a new service class following the pattern of `JiraService` or `ConfluenceService`
2. **New Analysis Logic**: Extend the `ContentAnalysisService` class
3. **New UI Pages**: Create new ERB templates and add routes to `AdminUI`
4. **New Sync Services**: Extend the `TicketCacheService` for new platforms

### Testing

The application includes basic error handling and connection testing. For production use, consider adding:

- Unit tests for service classes
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- UI automation tests
- Cache validation tests
