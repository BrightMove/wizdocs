# Overview

This is a list of hints from the founders that should be used for analysis

# Hints

- Bugs should take priority over feature requests
- Tickets that are open and are more than 365 days old since their last update should likely be closed
- Tickets that are likely duplicates of other tickets should be merged
- Insperity tickets that have the potential to impact new customer attachment rate should take priority over other feature requests
- Tickets that have multiple customer reports associated with them should take priority over other feature requests
- We should spend 80% of our resource time on new feature development and 20% of our time on technical debt reduction, operational and administrative tasks
