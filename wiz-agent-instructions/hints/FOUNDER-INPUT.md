# Overview

This is a list of hints from the founders that should be used for analysis

# Hints

- Our goal is to close tickets as quickly as possible.
- If a ticket is closed, there is no reason to analyze it.  Remove closed tickets from analysis.
- We want to improve the efficiency of the company by eliminating "noise" (close work we won't ever do, delete content we don't need)
- If a ticket is defined as "high priority", it means it is important and urgent.  The issue needs to be completed as soon as possible (within the next 1-3 sprints)
- If a ticket is defined as "low priority", it means it is important but not urgent.  The issue needs to be completed when resources are available or within the next 3-12 months, whichever comes first.
- If a ticket has been defined as "low priority", for more than 6 months, but has no recent progress, it should be recategorized as "high priority" due to lack of progress.
- If a ticket has no description, parent ticket, priority or customer association, it should be categorized as a "hygeine issue"
- Bugs should take priority over feature requests
- Tickets that are open and are more than 365 days old since their last update should likely be closed.
- Tickets that are likely duplicates of other tickets should be merged
- Insperity tickets that have the potential to impact new customer attachment rate should take priority over other feature requests
- Tickets that have multiple customer reports associated with them should take priority over other feature requests
- We should spend 80% of our resource time on new feature development and 20% of our time on technical debt reduction, operational and administrative tasks
- If a ticket doesn't have a description or if the description isn't very comprehensive, the ticket should be treated as simply an idea and the priority should be reduced.
- If a ticket has no description and doesn't have any comments, the ticket should be treated as simply an idea and the priority should be reduced.
- If a ticket has no description and hasn't had any comments in 365 days or more, the ticket should be treated as simply an idea and the priority should be reduced.
- If a ticket is simply an idea, but doesn't have any recent updates or activity related to customers, it should likely be closed.
