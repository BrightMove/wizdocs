# Overview

We keep all development and product enhancement tasks within Jira.  Jira tickets should have the following characteristics to be considered well formed and with good hygeine.

## Hygeine Rules

- **Proper Type**: Issues should be set as Epics, Improvements, Features, Stories or Bugs, unless a subtask of another Jira
- **Proper Priority**: Issues should be set with their proper priority based on the criticality of need by the customer
- **Proper Parent**: Issues should be assigned to the proper parent issue or Epic
- **Customer**: Whenever possible, the Jira ticket should reference the requesting customer or be marked as internal
- **Proper Review Status**: The appropriate review status and timeliness of an open Jira within the backlog should be reflected within the project
	- "Review Completed" means the Jira has been assessed by Customer Success team and is requested for development
	- "Reviewed but not Scheduled" means the Jira has been assessed by Customer Success team, but is not needed in the next 3 months
	- "Not Reviewed" means the Jira still needs to be assessed by the Customer Success team
- **Knowledge Base Links**: In some cases, there will be links to content within the Confluence wiki that is part of a Jira ticket, but this is not a certainty.  Links in Jira to Confluence and links from Confluence to Jira will periodically exist.  These links should be considered authoratative.
