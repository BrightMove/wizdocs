2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Click "Add webhook"
4. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/github`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Generate a secure secret and add it to `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - **Events**: Select "Pull requests" (or "Let me select individual events" and choose "Pull requests")
   - **Active**: Checked

#### For Organization-wide Monitoring
1. Go to your GitHub organization
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
3. Follow the same configuration as above
4. This will monitor all repositories in the organization

### 3. Notification Configuration

#### Slack Integration
1. Create a Slack app in your workspace
2. Add an Incoming Webhook integration
3. Copy the webhook URL and add it to `config.env`:

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

#### Email Notifications
Add email addresses to receive notifications:

```bash
NOTIFICATION_EMAILS=admin@company.com,tech-lead@company.com
```

## How It Works

### 1. Pull Request Lifecycle

#### When a PR is Opened
- System performs preliminary analysis
- Assesses potential impact based on changed files
- Stores analysis for future reference

#### When a PR is Updated
- Re-runs preliminary analysis
- Updates stored analysis with latest changes

#### When a PR is Merged
- Performs comprehensive impact analysis
- Identifies affected documentation
- Generates detailed recommendations
- Creates JIRA tickets if needed
- Sends notifications for high-impact changes

### 2. Impact Analysis Process

#### File Type Detection
The system categorizes changes based on file patterns:

- **API Changes**: Controller files, API endpoints, service layers
- **Database Changes**: SQL files, migration files, schema changes
- **Security Changes**: Authentication, authorization, security-related files
- **Configuration Changes**: YAML, JSON, properties files
- **Documentation Changes**: Markdown, README files

#### Impact Scoring
Impact levels are determined by:

- **Critical (10+ points)**: Breaking changes, security implications
- **High (8-9 points)**: API changes, database schema changes
- **Medium (4-7 points)**: Configuration changes, significant code changes
- **Low (1-3 points)**: Documentation updates, minor changes

### 3. Knowledge Base Correlation

The system analyzes existing documentation to identify:

- **Confluence pages** that might be affected by code changes
- **Intercom articles** that need updates
- **JIRA tickets** related to the changes
- **Missing documentation** that should be created

## JIRA Integration

### Automatic Ticket Creation
When high-impact changes are detected, the system automatically creates JIRA tickets with:

- **Summary**: "Update documentation after PR #X merge"
- **Description**: Detailed impact analysis and recommendations
- **Priority**: Based on impact level
- **Labels**: `documentation`, `pr-impact`, `pr-{number}`
- **Components**: Documentation team

### Ticket Content
Each ticket includes:

- PR details (repository, number, title, author)
- Impact analysis summary
- Specific recommendations
- List of affected documentation
- Action items for documentation updates

## Best Practices

### 1. Repository Organization
- Use consistent file naming conventions
- Organize code by feature/domain
- Keep documentation close to code
- Use meaningful commit messages

### 2. Documentation Strategy
- Update documentation as part of PR process
- Include documentation changes in PR descriptions
- Tag documentation team for high-impact changes
- Maintain documentation templates

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regularly review impact reports
- Update webhook configurations as needed
- Monitor notification delivery
- Adjust impact scoring based on team feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Webhook Not Receiving Events
- Verify webhook URL is accessible
- Check webhook secret configuration
- Ensure repository has webhook permissions
- Review GitHub webhook delivery logs

#### Analysis Not Working
- Verify GitHub token has correct permissions
- Check environment variable configuration
- Review application logs for errors
- Ensure repository is accessible

#### Notifications Not Sending
- Verify Slack webhook URL is correct
- Check email configuration
- Review notification service logs
- Test webhook endpoints manually

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Manual Testing
Test the webhook manually using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/github \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: pull_request" \
  -d @test-webhook-payload.json
```

## Security Considerations

### Webhook Security
- Always use webhook secrets
- Verify webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for webhook URLs
- Regularly rotate secrets

### Token Security
- Use minimal required permissions
- Store tokens securely
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Monitor token usage

### Access Control
- Restrict webhook access to trusted sources
- Implement rate limiting
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Log all webhook events
