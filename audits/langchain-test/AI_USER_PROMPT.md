# LangChain Integration Test Audit

This audit project tests the integration of LangChain for LLM and RAG functionality in the WizDocs knowledge base system.

## Test Objectives

1. **LLM Integration**: Test OpenAI LLM integration through LangChain
2. **RAG Implementation**: Test Retrieval-Augmented Generation using vector embeddings
3. **Content Analysis**: Test LLM-powered content analysis and audit capabilities
4. **Vector Search**: Test similarity search across knowledge base content

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic LLM Query
- Query: "What are the main features of the BrightMove ATS platform?"
- Expected: LLM should analyze content and provide a comprehensive response

### Scenario 2: RAG Search
- Query: "How do I configure SSO integration?"
- Expected: System should retrieve relevant content and generate contextual response

### Scenario 3: Content Audit
- Query: "Analyze the completeness of our API documentation"
- Expected: LLM should analyze content gaps and provide recommendations

### Scenario 4: Consistency Check
- Query: "Check for inconsistencies between code and documentation"
- Expected: System should identify conflicts and suggest resolutions

## Configuration Requirements

- OpenAI API Key configured
- Redis instance running for vector storage
- Content sources properly configured (Confluence, JIRA, GitHub, etc.)

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Enhanced Search**: More accurate and contextual search results
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: LLM-powered insights and recommendations
3. **Automated Auditing**: Proactive identification of content issues
4. **Improved Relevance**: Better content retrieval through vector similarity

## Success Criteria

- [ ] LLM responses are coherent and relevant
- [ ] RAG search returns appropriate content
- [ ] Vector embeddings are properly generated and stored
- [ ] Audit analysis provides actionable insights
- [ ] System gracefully falls back to simple search when LLM is unavailable
