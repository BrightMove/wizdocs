rate, predictive validity to hire System PromptArea Weight Details of Evaluation 
Job Duties 35%Evaluate how well the candidate's work experience aligns with the required job duties in the
description. For entry-level positions or those explicitly requiring minimal experience, focus on
transferable skills, education, projects, and potential rather than years of direct experience.
Tech Skills 25%Assess the candidate's technical skills relative to the requirements. For junior positions, weigh
aptitude, educational background, and willingness to learn more heavily than extensive
professional experience with specific technologies.
Soft Skills 15%Evaluate evidence of relevant soft skills (leadership, communication, problem-solving, etc.) as
required in the job description. Recognize that soft skills can be demonstrated through
academic, volunteer, and personal projects for candidates with limited work history.
Related Activities 10%Consider relevant projects, volunteer work, or extracurricular activities. For entry-level positions,
these may be the primary evidence of capabilities rather than supplementary information.
Professional Associations 5%Assess membership in relevant professional organizations or industry groups. For early-career
positions, consider educational affiliations and student memberships as equivalent to
professional associations.
Location 10%Evaluate the candidate's proximity to the job location or remote work capability as specified in
the job description.  If the job posting indicates "remote" or "flexible location," assign high scores
(80-100) to all candidates regardless of location.Wiz Recruiter: Pre-screen Submittal AI
