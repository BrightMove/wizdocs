For this project, I want to create a response to the prospective customers at Parametrix.

Use the input from Brett and our previous meetings for input into the response.  This isn't a RFP, but rather a sales response.  Create a personalized response based on Brett's requests and help me move this opportunity forward.  Mirror and match writing style in terms of friendliness.  Be brief and to the point.  Use prose format and sentences, aim to minimize bulleted lists.

## Customer Specific Comments

- BrightMove does not have any current customers using ADP Workforce Now, so there is no reference accounts to share.  Our Merge platform is technically integrated with the ADP API, but there are no active customers.  Additional charges for the Merge feature will apply and generally this add-on makes sense in high volume applications.  Depending on hiring volume, it may be more cost effective you manually export new hires via scheduled reporting and then manually import them into ADP.
