I. UNIVERSITY  AND PROJECT OVERVIEW  
This solicitation is issued by the University of Colorado (CU  or University ), through the Procurement  
Service  Center  (PSC) .  
 
CU is the state’s largest and most influential public research university,  a community of approximately 
67,000 stu dents and 28,000 employees spanning four campuses and system administration.  Every 
year CU graduates are thousands of stu dents who fill critical workforce needs across the state. CU is 
the state’s third largest  public  employer with an annual operating budget of $ 6.3 billion. CU faculty 
attracted $ 1.6 billion in  sponsored research awards to conduct research in economic sectors critical 
to the state and nation, including energy, bioscience, aerospace, and health care. Overall, CU  and its 
CU Anschutz affiliate hospitals  contribute  approximately $ 17.2  billion annually to the state’s economy.  
 
The proposal must be prepared and submitted in accordance with the requirements and procedures 
contained in this RFP document and the University’s  policies , rules, and procedures . Compliance with 
these requirements by the Proposer is mandatory and is a condition of responsiveness. Any failure to

 RFP_F -0000000061   Page 8  
II. SCOPE OF WORK , QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS  
 
1. Introduction  
 
A. BACKGROUND:  
The University of Colorado (CU) is a multi -campus public university that provides education, research, 
and healthcare services across Colorado and beyond. Each campus has its own unique mission and 
way of operating.  
 
CU’s current recruitment system, will reach the end of its contract in 2027. We're now preparing to 
select and launch a new system to support hiring across the campuses. This project aims to find a 
solution that fits the varied recruiting needs of a university environment, including different types of 
employees, workflows, and policies across campuses.  
 
B. PROJECT OVERVIEW:  
We are looking for a modern, cloud -based Applicant Tracking System (ATS). This tool will help CU 
manage every stage of the hiring process — from writing job descriptions and posting open positions 
to reviewing applicants, scheduling interviews, making offe rs, and onboarding new employees.  
 
The goal is to:  
- Make recruiting easier and faster for hiring teams  
- Improve the experience for job candidates  
- Meet legal and university hiring requirements  
 
We need a system that supports the following key features:  
- Easy review and approval of job descriptions, with those details connected to job postings  
- Automatic posting to internal and external job boards  
- Custom hiring workflows to match campus -specific practices  
- Tools to manage candidates — filter resumes, send emails, schedule interviews  
- Collaboration features so teams can review applicants and share feedback  
- Reporting tools to track hiring speed, diversity data, and where applicants are coming from  
- Integration with CU’s existing tools, like our HR system (Oracle PeopleSoft HCM 9.2), single 
sign-on (SSO), and background checks  
- Simple and accessible user experience for applicants and CU employees  
 
CU uses a position -based staffing model. That means instead of tracking jobs by employee or job title, 
we define jobs by positions in the HR system. Each position holds its own data, like salary and working 
hours. These details stay tied to the position, e ven when different employees occupy it over time. 
Each position needs a unique job description and approval before recruiting starts. Ideally, the new 
ATS will manage this step and link key details directly into job postings once approved.  
 
C. PROJECT GOALS:  
Our new ATS should help CU:  
1. Stay compliant with employment laws and university policies  
2. Reduce manual steps by automating workflows and features  
3. Organize job -related documents clearly and securely  
4. Include job description approvals and workflows in the system  
5. Generate useful hiring reports and data dashboards  
 
 RFP_F -0000000061   Page 9  
6. Create a smooth experience for candidates and CU staff  
 
The system should work well for both faculty and staff hiring, across the CU campuses. We want 
something that’s flexible, easy to use, and aligns with our current and future needs — from 
creating job descriptions and postings to managing candidate materials securely.  
 
D. DELIVERABLES  
The ideal system should work well for both faculty and staff hiring across different CU campuses , each 
of which has unique needs.  
 
The proposed system must be able to : 
- Support all types of hiring — faculty and staff, across System Administration, with the 
opportunity for the  four campuses  to use the system if they choose . 
- Integrate  easily with our current HR tools like Oracle PeopleSoft and other internal systems.  
- Improve the experience for everyone — from job seekers to hiring teams.  
- Handle every part of hiring: writing job descriptions, posting jobs, reviewing applicants, 
coordinating interviews, and making offers.  
 
In addition, proposals must be  clear in their submissions about the following:  
- All data storage limitations  
- All email sending limits  
- System configuration limits, such as:  
o Number of custom fields  
o Email templates  
o Forms  
o Workflow steps  
o Data lists  
o Any other system limitations, or limitations of the platform itself  
 
CU also seeks the following capabilities : 
- Secure and organized storage of applicant materials that meets legal and university standards, 
with audit trails.  
- Tools for different users like recruiters, hiring managers, HR staff, search committees, and job 
applicants.  
- A simple and intuitive design so it’s easy to use and collaborate, even with complex workflows.  
- Built -in tools for job description review and approval, with automatic updates to job postings 
once a position is approved.  
- Reporting capabilities to meet federal hiring requirements (EEO and OFCCP) and support 
custom reports as needed.  
- Strong integration with CU's existing systems and tools — including Outlook, OnBase, Textio, 
CrossChq, and others.  
- Customizable templates and workflows that CU staff can easily adjust without vendor 
assistance.  
- Communication tools that support both scheduled messages and on -the-fly emails — for 
internal teams and external candidates.  
- Flexibility to serve CU’s four campuses, each with its own hiring process and employee 
population . 
 
 
 
 RFP_F -0000000061   Page 10  
 
E. RESPONSIBILITIES  
CU is looking for a vendor that will be a strong partner — helping not only with setting up the new 
hiring system but also supporting it throughout the life of the contract.  
What the Vendor Will Do:  
- Set up and validate the system, and support CU with final User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for 
the system to be ready and usable by May 2027.  
- Work alongside CU staff for implementation  
- Configure  the system to match CU’s needs and technology  
- Provide training and helpful documentation for CU employees  
- Ensure the system works well through quality checks  
- Offer ongoing support after the system goes live  
- Help plan and carry out the move of existing data into the new system  
- Build system integrations  between the ATS and CU’s existing tech  
- Create dashboards and reports to help track hiring data  
 
What CU Will Provide:  
- Access to staff, systems, and resources needed for planning and setup  
- Dedicated employees to work with the vendor during the project  
- IT support to help with system setup and integrations  
- CU will retain full ownership of its data  
- CU must comply with the Colorado Public Records Act, which overrides any other agreements 
about confidentiality.

11. Confi dentiality of Records  
Documents submitted to or created by the University in response to this solicitation are subject

University policies and procedures, all documents submitted to or created by the University in 
response to this solicitation are confidential and privileged and may not be inspected until an 
award is made or the solicita tion is cancelled by the University.  An award is made when the 
University formally executes a contra ct resulting from this solicitation. A solicitation is cancelled 
when notice of such cancellation is posted on University’s BidNet Website.  
  
CORA requires the University to withhold certain information, including trade secrets, confidential 
commercial and financial data, or privileged information. To designate portions of the solicitation 
as confidential, Proposer must:

response to this solicitation. Proposer is responsible for properly and adequately 
redacting any data which Proposer desires to remain confidential. If entire pages or 
sections are removed, a page indicating that the page or section has been redacted must 
represent the redacted pages.  Failure to provide a secondary response with a redacted 
copy may result in disclosure of an unredacted copy under CORA.  
4. Provide a written explanation of the basis under which each redacted item has been 
deemed confidential, making refence to the exception under CORA and/or any other law 
restricting disclosure.
