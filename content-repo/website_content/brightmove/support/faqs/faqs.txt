• For more technical details: Scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given document is to a user's query. The idea behind the VSM is that the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of Boolean logic in the query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements to this model to support Boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM-based system at the heart.

• There are two Company Preferences that affect what happens with the disqualified candidates.
• When you are creating a job for the first time, at any point you can choose to assign specific BQ's to this job. Specifically, BQ's that are not already posted onto the Portal. To avoid a question being applied to all jobs unintentionally, you should deselect the "Show on Portal" option when creating the qualification question. Once a job has submittals, you can no longer add BQ's to that job, so it is important that you add the BQ's when you are creating the job. In cases where a job already has submittals and you need to add qualification questions, you would need to recreate the job position.
