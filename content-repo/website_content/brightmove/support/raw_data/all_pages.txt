  <h1 class="mb-1 font-primary text-2xl font-bold leading-10 text-body-primary-color">What is the Score in Power Search?</h1>
CONTENT:
  Basically, the score is a number that represents how well any particular result matches what you searched for.
  Here are some more technical details if you were curious: Scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a User's query. The idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the Query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements to this model to support boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM based system at the heart.

CONTENT:
  Release 2022.3.0 includes some bug fixes and the following system improvements:
  We've added more detailed logging of changes being made to all profile types by users in the Audit tab of Applicants/Candidates, Jobs, Clients, Contacts/Hiring Managers, Client Office/Location, Opportunities and Placements.
  In addition to showing the original create date and user of the profile, we will also show you a log of all changes/edits made to the profiles, what it was changed from / to, and which user performed the edit with date and time stamp.
  This feature is a customer-driven improvement so we thank you for letting us know you wanted better audit tracking on profiles!
  We've improved the modal window usability in the system so that while a modal window is open, if you click outside of it, the modal will no longer close out. It will remain open so you don't lose the data you've entered into it. You can close the modal window by saving or click the "x" in the upper right to close it out and return to the main screen.
  Power Search Location filters have been enhanced to give you more location options than ever before. We'll no longer limit the amount of results that are displayed when entering a city/state or zip code.
  Power Search pagination behavior has been enhanced to allow you to leave the power search screen and upon return, pick up where you were in the results pagination. You'll no longer be defaulted back to page one of results and to scroll back to the page you were previous on.
  When in Power Search and clicks into an Applicant profile or performs a bulk action, then return to search you will come back to the page you were on when you left that search.
  These improvements were all customer-driven requests! We thank our customers who let us know these were needed improvements to the system. All our customers can request improvements or new features at any time within BrightMove Help menu> Request BrightMove Feature.

  We're thrilled to share exciting news about the upcoming release of a new feature within ATS called Domain and Email Verification. These changes, set to take effect on Sunday, March 31, 2024, are designed to enhance the security and authenticity of your communication processes.
  Starting from March 31, 2024, BrightMove is implementing new features for Domain and Email Verification, aiming to strengthen the verification processes associated with your domain and email communications.
  In order to be able to view and change email domains within a company's configuration, the user must have the
  permission assigned to a role they have. Without this permission, the user cannot see the Email Domains link on the Company Settings screen.
  For accounts whose domains are currently configured within BrightMove, we have streamlined the process by automatically verifying the domain through our "soft" verification process. This approach grandfathers in your company's domain and enables the domain to be Ready for Use by your users immediately. Prior to December 31, 2023, BrightMove softly verified all existing domains for sending outbound emails.
  However, this does not mean your domain has been verified from a DNS perspective. In 2024, many domain name service providers, web hosting companies and email service providers are implementing new, stricter email security policies related to domain verification.
  .
  To ensure a seamless transition, we kindly ask Account Admins (users with the
  permission) to:
  Go to the "Email Domains" screen within "Company Settings" to verify that their email domains are currently configured properly.
  Check if the status of each domain that you send email from and confirm it is "Ready For Use"
  If there is a domain that you wish to send email from that is not listed, add it and follow the instructions to verify the domain.
  If your domain is "Ready For Use" (indicated by a green checkmark) this means the email domain can be used by your company's users register verified emails.
  If your domain is not "Ready For Use" (indicated by a red exclamation point) follow the instructions under the "Actions" column before March 31, 2024, to ensure uninterrupted service.
  If your domain has any red exclamation points shown, follow the instructions under the Actions column.
  For all users, we request you to validate and update your verified email addresses from your manage profile screen.
  To do this:
  Select "Settings" in the top right corner.
  Navigate to "Profile"
  Update your email address to ensure accurate and authenticated communication.
  For users sending emails from BrightMove using addresses with external domains, we recommend reviewing and updating your email configuration. This ensures that your emails are seamlessly authenticated and delivered.
  Our dedicated support team is ready to assist you throughout this process. If you have any questions or need guidance on verifying your DNS settings, configuring your email domains, or updating your profile, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can reach the support team via the chat feature within the application, or by sending an email to
  We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible, ensuring uninterrupted service for your BrightMove experience.
  We appreciate your prompt attention to these updates, as they are crucial for maintaining the security and reliability of your communication channels.

CONTENT:
  Release 2022.13.0 on Saturday, November 19, 2022 contains multiple user experience improvements, a data accessibility upgrade for our ad-hoc reporting module, and three bug fixes. This release is a bit smaller when compared to a typical release. This is based on a shortened sprint cycle since our last production release. This release comes as a fast follower to version 2022.12.0 which was deployed earlier this month. Our goal for having two releases in November was to get these helpful user experience improvements and bug fixes into the platform before the holiday season begins in full effect.
  In this release, we deployed a simple yet commonly encountered user experience improvement that allows users to copy the field values they routinely need to reference to their clipboard. Within the Candidate, Client, Client Contact and Requirement screens, you will find the Copy to Clipboard Helper now accessible via the icon you'd typically expect for this operation. The helper has been tied to the unique ID fields for these core data domains. Additionally, we have placed the Copy to Clipboard Helper next to the API Key and the New Portal URL fields administrative settings.
  In this release, we deployed an improvement related to the notification icon in the top right masthead section of the UI. This improvement also integrates within the browser's tab of the page you are viewing. When notifications are recognized by BrightMove, the UI now dynamically refreshes in realtime with the notification event. The ability to simplify the management of notification event messages was a feature specifically asked for by our customers, and as such we've introduced these improvements in release 2022.13.0.
  In this release, we deployed a change to default to the list of free job boards list on the job board posting tab of the job screen. We find this as a simple way to reduce clicks for our users when creating jobs, as this is a commonly viewed tab within the platform.
  In this release, we made it possible for our users to export ad-hoc report results to JSON format. This increases the portability of data saved within the ATS by enabling export to the commonly supported JSON format.
  This fix corrects an issue that would result in the parsing and saving of duplicate employment history records for candidates when re-parsing their resume using the resume parser.
  In the activities screens for candidates and submittals, we discovered a UI control bug that is encountered when trying to set an end date for an activity that occurs prior to the start date. This bug did not introduce any data quality issues for our customers, but instead had the potential to cause frustration from a user experience. This change improves the handling of date inputs for activities.
  This fix corrects an issue for users who are trying to register new interviewers within the system, who do not already have an account within BrightMove.

This release contains significant enhancements to job posting, integration management, user interface improvements, and several customer-facing fixes to improve overall system functionality and user experience.
  The following changes were deployed as part of this release:
  : Improved application acceptance logic to properly validate applications against job Basic Qualifications (BQs). Applications missing required BQs will now be appropriately rejected with proper error handling for Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and Generic job board endpoints.
  : Added automatic link generation for internally posted jobs. The internal portal link now appears on the Job profile under the "Sharing/Posting Section" with intelligent filtering based on enabled publishing types and portal preferences.
  : Updated the Job Board tab to accurately reflect job boards enabled for each company based on package type and Direct Employer status. HR packages now show all available boards, while Staffing & RPO packages display boards based on Direct Employer configuration.
  : Implemented consistent answer ranking for multiple choice questions across all interfaces. Answers now appear properly sorted in Interview Questions page, Job Interview Questions tab, Conduct Interview modal, and Interview PDFs.
  : Fixed issue preventing users from saving submittal activity due to null submittal status errors. Enhanced the submittal workflow to include proper table refresh when activities are deleted.
  : Resolved issue where "Select Candidate" button checkboxes weren't updating properly. The selection functionality now works correctly on both applicant folder pages and contact submittal tabs.
  : Fixed BrightSync management modal to display current Office 365 configuration data accurately instead of showing empty fields. The modal now properly shows existing Tenant ID and configuration settings.
  : Enhanced audit logging to capture salary changes when creating or editing placement activities. Current and Desired pay modifications are now properly tracked in the candidate audit trail.
  : Updated the submittal card interface in BrightFlow view with a clearer document icon and "view resume" tooltip for better user experience and functionality clarity.
  This release affects all editions.
  Release 2025.7.0 on Thursday, June 5, 2025, represents our seventh production deployment of 2025. This release minor improvements to the email delivery tracking features as well as several changes to support the release of Engage, later this year.
  The following changes were deployed as part of this release:
  :  Event tracking of messages sent via communication templates from submittal workflow status changes are now tracked via our
  .
  : The disposition feed was updated to have the proper create date of the submittal activity.  Prior to this fix, the create date of the job was being sent instead of the create date of the activity, skewing the disposition results.
  : We deployed several platform changes in advance of new product releases later this year.
  This release affects all editions.
  Release 2025.6.0 on Wednesday, May 14, 2025, represents our sixth production deployment of 2025. This release contains several customer-facing improvements and internal system enhancements to improve overall system functionality and user experience.
  The following changes were deployed as part of this release:
  : Our email composer now includes two new plugins:
  : Easily see how your email will appear to recipients before sending
  : Access and edit the HTML code directly for advanced customization
  Improved editor controls from menu, right click and Control-C/Control-V
  : We've made significant improvements to our email system, ensuring that invalid email addresses will no longer cause an entire email batch to be sent to the replay queue, delaying successful delivery. Valid emails in a batch will continue to be sent even if some addresses are invalid.
  : We've standardized the action buttons across both the Applicant and Requirement Submittal tabs, creating a more intuitive and consistent user experience.  For example, the Google Maps link to illustrate the distance between the Applicant's home address and the job location are accessible from the More dropdown on both screens now.
  : Our Wiz AI now has enhanced context awareness across multiple areas:
  Job descriptions now include requirement context
  Emails from the Requirement Submittal Tab include job context
  Individual applicant and contact emails include relevant context
  Sender and receiver context for more personalized communication
  : Now all additional hiring managers listed on a job will receive the
  triggered by submittal status changes, not just the primary hiring manager.

  Release 2025.5.0 on Saturday, April 26, 2025, represents our fifth production deployment of 2025. This release contains several customer-facing improvements and internal system enhancements to improve overall system functionality and user experience.
  The following changes were deployed as part of this release:
  Submittal Tab Redesign:  We redesigned the layout of the submittal tab on the candidate screen and the job screen.  The reason for this redesign is reduce horizontal scrolling and to reduce frustration for the user when critical buttons are off the main screen viewport.
  Contact Avatar Fix: We've resolved an issue where manager avatars were displaying as broken images after upload.
  Dashboard Chart Improvements: Charts on the Applicant and Requirement Dashboard tabs now display "no data available for this chart" when no data exists, providing clearer visual feedback.
  Client Logo Updates: We've implemented a new API for generating client logos, ensuring more accurate and up-to-date company branding.
  Enhanced AI Prompts: We've improved our
  functionality for emails and SMS, removing unnecessary commentary and ensuring correct formatting when using substitution fields.
  Resume Parsing Error Handling: We've enhanced our resume parsing system with better error handling and logging. If the parser encounters an error, you'll now receive a clear notification popup after upload.
  Customizable Welcome Emails: Company admins can now select from predefined communication templates when granting system access to managers. This feature allows for easy customization and personalization of the welcome email. Access these templates through the new 'Engage Settings' link under Settings.
  Contact Profile Viewing: We've resolved an issue where managers were unable to view other managers' profiles despite having the proper permissions.
  Automatic Role Assignment: When an RPO Parent user creates a new company via RPO template, the user will now be automatically assigned the "Administration" role to the newly created company, eliminating the need for manual role assignment.
  Enhanced Data Tables: The Company Management Security modal now features an improved data table interface for better usability.
  ZipRecruiter Disposition Feedback: We've added ZipRecruiter to our Job Board Disposition Feedback project, ensuring continued support for the organic feed.

CONTENT:
  This version of BrightMove adds an improvement to our Duplicate Management screens.
  We've re-architected how our Duplication Management screen works in order to make it faster and easier than ever for our customers to manage duplicate profiles!
  The default criteria to determine if profiles are duplicates for both Candidates and managers are:
  First name
  Last name
  Email address
  (You can change the defaults for your company if you'd like in
  >
  .)
  Duplicates are auto-calculated by the system every couple hours now so you will see a fresh list when you venture to that screen. We've also added a button to Recalculate Duplicates (upper right) in the event you need to refresh the list in real-time.
  To view and manage your duplicate profiles:
  Click the Quick Links menu (in upper right)
  Settings
  Choose the Duplicate Candidates or Duplicate Managers section
  You will be shown a list of duplicate profiles and the number of duplicates each particular person has.
  Click Manage to view and choose the profile that should remain the primary (and that the duplicates will get merged into).
  Click Save.

  BrightMove does not have a direct relationship or integration with LinkedIn. You can use Zapier to set up social posting to LinkedIn, or LinkedIn can scrape jobs directly from your BrightMove portal. A LinkedIn representative should be able to assist with this second option.
  There is a setting you can enable that prevents applicants from being able to apply to closed jobs. In your Settings menu, go to "Company Preferences." The preference you are looking for is "Disable Closed Job View." Make sure this is turned on to prevent applicants from applying to closed jobs.Applications might also be automatically rejected if the job is closed or inactive. Ensure the job status is active and visible to candidates to prevent unnecessary rejections. You can learn more about managing job postings from this article:

  Indeed requires all new staffing companies to have a sponsored visibility to post jobs. If you have not already done so, please contact Indeed support to inquire how to do this.
  Here is a
  that BrightMove submits your jobs.
  It is a number that represents how well a particular result matches your search.
  For more technical details: Scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given document is to a user's query. The idea behind the VSM is that the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of Boolean logic in the query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements to this model to support Boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM-based system at the heart.
  Please make sure that submittal status and activity type are set to viewable for hiring managers in Settings > Submittal Workflow. These options will be under the "Statuses" and "Activity Types" tabs.
  Applications may be rejected due to several reasons. Here are common causes:
  Ensure all application answers align with job requirements and are completed accurately.

  Verify the status of jobs to ensure they are open and visible to candidates. See our guide on managing job postings:

  Adjust portal settings like categories and job status to maintain accessibility for candidates. Read our guide:

  Align system preferences for rejecting profiles with your hiring priorities.
  Review application details to align with requirements.

CONTENT:
  This version of BrightMove adds the ability to manage your company social media logo when sharing BrightMove jobs to social media sites! You can now control what image appears with your job postings on social media at the company and/or job level. (This is a customer requested new feature!)
  Gone are the days of not knowing where a social media site is pulling an image from that it is showing with your job or that it is displaying a HUGE image that is blurry or cut-off. YOU can now control the social media image that is show with your posted jobs at the job level or for all jobs in the account!
  , a company that provides advisory services, research, and user reviews on software applications for businesses, ran a
  with potential applicants that asked if the presence of images or videos in an online job posting made the company that posted it more attractive and the key findings were:
  "Fifty-one percent of respondents would be more attracted to a company that had job postings with visual elements (images or videos) than to a company that didn’t.
  Respondents were more attracted to companies that have images in their job postings than to those that have videos (45 percent versus 31 percent)."
  The better looking your job ad, the more professional your organization will look and the more credible it will appear. Managing your default social media images in your BrightMove account and job postings will help you achieve this.
  A company level social media image will be used as the default social media image for all jobs shared to social media sites in the event there is not one assigned at the job level. (If no social media image has been assigned at the company or job levels, the site being posted to will pull an image itself. This is not always a flattering or well defined image.)
  To set your social media image at the Company level (Account level) to be used for all jobs:
  1.
  >
  2. Click to the
  tab
  3. Click the
  Image button (upper right)
  4. Either
  into the top box OR

  A Job level social media image will be used on a per-job basis. In the event a social media image is not assigned to a job, the company level social media image will be used by default. (If no social media image has been assigned at the company or job levels, the site being posted to will pull an image itself. This is not always a flattering or well defined image.)

CONTENT:
  Version 2022.5.0 contains some exciting improvements and additions and will be released on Saturday, May 21st.
  Our customers asked for a sound alert for BrightMove notifications and we're happy to deliver!
  This sound preference will be released turned off but individuals can go to Settings>Toggle Alerts and click to turn it on if they desire a sound notification when notifications become due. All users will continue to see the notification icon in the upper right of the screen as well, this will not change.
  Due to the changed nature of work location options in a post-COVID world, we've added two additional option boxes to join the existing Work From Home option on all job profiles: Work Hybrid and Work Remote.
  : This means the job is a combination of work from home some of the time and on location at an office some of the time. (Ex. Three days WFH with 2 days required in person at the office each week)
  : This means the job can be done remotely
  : This is the literal "work from home" option. Meaning the job is done from home and does not require any time on location at an office or travel.
  We've resolved slowness for some customers in the Candidate Source screen.

  BrightMove version 19.4 will be released on Saturday, April 17th. This article summarizes what is available in the newest version.
  As part of BrightMove's continued commitment to cybersecurity, we are proud to launch Two-Factor Authentication. Each user will need to enable the two-factor authentication for their own profile, but company admins can see who has or has not set up two-factor authentication. Currently, authentication is available through a variety of phone apps. We also highly recommend that users set up security questions. This will allow the BrightMove Support team to verify your identity and remove the two-factor authentication if you ever lose your device.
  Great News! We have upgraded our email parser. Now creating candidate profiles from emails is real-time and up to 30 times faster. You can begin using this new parser with the release on Saturday. Simply change the email address ending from @brightmove.com to @parser.brightmove.ai. The old @brightmove.com email parsers will no longer be supported after 5/31/21. Please be sure to update anywhere the address may be saved.
  Have more control than ever over your company brand with customizable Forgot Password Email Templates. You can use the new substitution fields ForgotPasswordLink and ForgotPasswordCode to create a custom message or instructions for your candidates when they click Forgot Password on your Candidate Experience Portal.
  We have added the ability to copy the branding and settings from an existing portal in BrightMove when creating a new portal using the
  feature.

  Release 2022.12.0 on Saturday, November 5, 2022 contains user experience improvements, security & audit improvements, and improvements related to the BrightMove integration framework based on webhooks. There are also several major behind-the-scenes changes that are being deployed with appropriate feature switches in place (to disable the new capabilities). These behind-the-scenes changes are needed for future releases over the coming months.
  In this release, we made user experience improvements related to the candidate source attribute when searching for candidates within Power Search. Some users that have large numbers of candidate sources were unable to view the source list easily. This release includes logic & performance improvements to the source lookup, that allows for a candidate source list result set in excess of 50 sources.
  In this release, we improved the logic in the candidate dashboard pane to no longer include the counts of jobs related to deleted client records.
  When using the dark mode theme, we found certain fields to not be visible. Changes in this release allows for users who have selected the dark mode theme to be able to view all of the fields with contrast.
  In this release, we fixed a logic error in one of the activity data services that has affected RPO customers. The change that is being introduced in this release fixes a logic error by including both the RPO parent and RPO child account activity IDs as part of the data service execution. This is to reduce duplicate records which are returned in some scenarios.
  In this release, we made it possible for users with the Administrator role to see the last login date for accounts within their instance. By going to the Employee Profile > Audit tab, administrators can now see the last login date of the user.
  Webhooks are used to integrated with 3rd party services via web services. In this deployment, we added support to handle the merge of applicants and client contacts to downstream services. Webhooks are invoked or fired when events occur.
  When two applicants are merged within ATS, the primary applicant is considered the surviving record and the non-primary applicant does not have survivorship. Upon merge, the UPDATE webhook is fired on the primary applicant and the DELETE webhook is fired on the secondary applicant.
  When two client contacts are merged within ATS, the primary client contact is considered the surviving record and the non-primary applicant does not have survivorship. Upon merge, the UPDATE webhook is fired on the primary client contact and the DELETE webhook is fired on the secondary client contact.
  The client contact webhook events were created in this release. Prior to 2022.12.0 they didn't exist.

This release is a major release and contains two significant upgrades to the BrightMove Platform, the ability to assign tasks to alternative users and a major refactoring of the hiring manager security framework.
  This release affects all editions.
  In this release, we're delivering the functionality that allows users to assign tasks to other users as part of the submittal workflow. In the case where your users have the new permission
  , they can now place submittal activities onto other users' task list from within BrightMove. This feature will allow for customers to use BrightMove to manage tasks and submittals across teams more efficiently.
  In this release, we have rewritten the hiring manager security framework for performance improvements, scalability and flexibility. While this change should result in no visible change for users at the time of rollout, by adopting our robust core security framework for the hiring manager user types, this sets the stage for more flexibility for customers to control what hiring managers can do within the platform.
  Release 2024.2.0 on Saturday, January 27, 2024 at 11pm ET represents the second production deployment of 2024. This release is a maintenance release and contains several minor infrastructure configuration changes and a few bug fixes.
  This release affects all editions.

  We have expanded on our job approver functionality by adding the ability for hiring managers, recruiters, and HR department staff to create delegates for job approval chains.
  Possible use cases:
  A hiring manager is out on PTO and assigns another HM to approve jobs on their behalf between a certain date range while they are out.
  Peers can grant perpetual delegate authority to each other to create an "Approval Group" to ensure jobs are routed through the process with efficiency and quality.
  The delegation of approval authority is easily removed and transparent to all users in the approval chain.
  New fields show who the current approver is, who the next approver in line is, and who has been delegated to approve jobs on that manager's behalf. Once everyone in the chain has approved the job, then it is open for recruiting.

Additionally, this migration provides a foundation for more advanced reporting and analytics services in the future to benefit our customers.

  BrightMove has established a new partnership with CareerJet. Because of this, BrightMove has implemented a feed of our customers' jobs to CareerJet and has integrated the Apply Now feature within that feed, so that candidate applications are directly ingested into BrightMove. CareerJet is a job search engine designed to make the process of finding a job on the internet easier for the user. It maps the huge selection of job offerings available on the internet in one extensive database by referencing job listings originating from job boards, recruitment agency websites and large specialist recruitment sites. Using a fast and straightforward interface, users can query this database and save themselves the trouble of visiting each site individually. CareerJet currently has over 18 million visits per month globally, covering 150 countries and 30 languages.
  ​
  In this release, we have deployed a major enhancement to our BrightMatch feature. It allows you to search the web for publicly listed jobs that match your candidates skills without leaving BrightMove, enabling you to find potential prospective customers for your top candidates who are coming off assignment. BrightMatch is only available to customers who use the BrightMove for Staffing and BrightMove for RPO products.
  In this release, we have deployed a minor fix to decorate required UDF fields with the standard UI treatment of a green outline. This pre-flight check informs users which UDF fields are required for the user to successfully submit the form.
  In this release, we have deployed a bug fix to our BrightSync message parsing service. This fix is to correct the improper association of the user to be the Sender of email messages instead of the Recipient.
  BrightMove has deployed a new status monitoring service (Instatus) which will be rolled out fully in an upcoming release. We have integrated our user data service synchronization to keep this monitoring system up to date with our customers' contact info. This service will enable BrightMove to offer best overall uptime & performance to our customers in the years to come.
  Happy New Year from BrightMove! We are excited to kick off the new year with some feature improvements and enhancements.
  Release 2023.1.0 on Saturday, January 7, 2023 represents the first production release of 2023. This release contains a customer-requested enhancement to the BrightMove ad hoc reporting service, several user experience improvements, a security upgrade, and a few bug fixes. As we gear up for major upgrades later in Q1, there are also several behind-the-scenes changes related to our candidate experience portal platform & our new
  , that are being deployed with feature flags in place (to disable the new capabilities). Be sure to watch your inbox for information on these exciting new capabilities in the coming months.
  In this release, we made a core user experience improvement related to the ad hoc reporting module by enabling some new data types. Coming directly from a customer request, we added support for a currency data type and new date field formatting. These formatting styles are applied based on a combination of the format the user selects as well as their locale settings within the profile. The primary use case this enables gives the ability to apply formatting to the fields of exported reports.
  We implemented this new feature with a
  approach. In other words, current ad hoc reports will not change based on this new feature. In order to apply currency & date formatting, the report author or an administrator will need to select a control on the dynamic report to apply formatting OR apply the formatting control against the saved report.
  This fix corrects a bug in the duplicate candidate manager module that was observed then the merged candidates had overlapping time cards. Previously, an error would occur when trying to merge candidates. Now, the merge completes and the time cards survive under the merged candidate.
  This fix corrects a bug in the sendout of submittals to hiring managers. Previously, the sendout message would contain the first submittal status in the candidate submittal history. With this fix, BrightMove now sets the current submittal status into the sendout message.
  This fix corrects a bug in the UI control of UDF drop downs on the Candidate screens. When editing a candidate from the candidate screen, the UDF drop down form elements now do not reset to
  .
  A minor UI fix - we added the missing pencil icon next to the Sales Person edit link on the Client Contact screen.
  This fix corrects a logic error when scrolling through a result set delivered from a Power Search using the carousel control. When the Power Search result is filtered by a field AND subsequently that field is updated by the user on the current result set record, the index control would break and an error would occur. This fix corrects the carousel control.
  This is a control fix - we created a preventative measure to avoid sending duplicate SMS messages from the platform when clicking the back button on the browser.
  The BrightMove security & engineering team is always monitoring the platform for stability & security. In February 2022, BrightMove rapidly deployed a security patch to protect against a zero-day vulnerability that our team became aware of through the security channels we monitor. This vulnerability was in 3rd party code BrightMove leverages, not code authored by BrightMove directly. A patch deployment was done to protect our clients & infrastructure against this published exploit. During this patch, there was some technical debt that we accumulated, in the form of redundant files and manual processes. Our engineering team worked with the author of the 3rd party code to reintegrate the secured code into our automated development pipeline.
  While this is all behind the scenes to our customers and perhaps seems like "sausage making", the key point to share is we are constantly looking for opportunities to increase the reliability, security and performance of our platform.

  Release 2022.11.0 on Saturday, October 15, 2022 contains a hardened deployment of our Sense API integration, performance improvements to the Candidate Power Search and some security & audit improvements. There are also several minor bug fixes included with this release like a UI fix to the contract placement report & a logic fix to the charts on the dashboard pane of the requirement screen.
  Our security model is robust, in that all user activity is recorded via a comprehensive audit logging service. Coming out of multiple requests from our customers, we have added additional visibility to audit records for Security Roles & Client Contacts.
  For users with the
  role, you can now see a historical view of changes made to security roles within the UI. This includes the addition or removal of permissions to a security role, when the change was made and who made the change.
  In this release, we provide a view to the historical changes to client contact records. This providers users with the ability to see what change was made to a contact record, who made it and when it was made.
  In this release, we made performance and user experience improvements related to the location lookup when searching for candidates. Locations are
  ,
  ,
  combinations. The location lookup is a core service that powers the Candidate Power Search, as it enables the user with the ability to do geographic radius searches. For example, if you wish to lookup all candidates within a 25 mile radius of the center of a specific city, the
  is what provides this capability. This release includes logic & performance improvements to the location lookup, including a maximum location result set of 500 city/state/zip code combinations.
  Over the past several months, BrightMove and
  have been testing an integration between our two services. This deployment contains some major enhancements to that API integration, specifically around messaging within the webhooks component, which is used for data synchronization between the two services. If you'd like more information on the BrightMove-Sense integration, please open a ticket with
  and a customer success team member will be glad to assist you.

  Recently, web browsers have disabled the opening of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) links. FTP is still a very secure way to download files when the link is from a trusted source such as your BrightMove. While these additional steps are cumbersome, they allow us to secure your data download.
  FileZilla
  - Is a Windows FTP Client that is Free to download and install.
  Please follow the below instructions to download your XML data export from BrightMove.
  1. Type
  into the Host field in upper left.
  2. Hit the QuickConnect button in upper right.
  (If a modal pop-up appears that says "Insecure FTP connection", click OK to continue)
  3. On right side, look for the "Remote Site" section > "data" directory (double click) and a directory should appear below.
  4. Next, in the upper menu> choose Transfer> Manual Transfer.
  5. A new modal window will appear (see below).
  In the email you received from BrightMove that contained the FTP link to your data, there is a number you'll need to copy and paste into the Manual Transfer screen (shown above).
  The emailed link looks like this:
  6. Copy only the numerical (highlighted below) portion of the link and include the .zip ending.
  7. Paste the copied portion into 2 places on the manual transfer screen:
  a) Local File section (left side)> File > paste after desired folder location.
  b) Remote file section (right side) > File> paste into empty box.
  8. Click the "Start transfer immediately" checkbox at the bottom of the modal.
  9. Click OK button.
  ​The files will then be transferred. This may take a couple minutes to complete. The bottom of the screen should show a transfer in progress and the top of the screen should show the starting download/file transfer successful/ etc.

  From Account settings in SimpleTexting.com, you will need to set up a forwarding address using your BrightMove API Key, and optionally, your Email and /or Phone for SMS responses to go to so they can be captured as activities in BrightMove.

  Recently, web browsers have disabled the opening of File Transfer Protocol (FTP) links. FTP is still a very secure way to download files when the link is from a trusted source such as your BrightMove. While these additional steps are cumbersome, they allow us to secure your data download.
  FileZilla
  - Is a Windows FTP Client that is Free to download and install.
  Please follow the below instructions to download your Attachments export from BrightMove.
  1. Type
  into the Host field in upper left.
  2. Hit the QuickConnect button in upper right.
  (If a modal pop-up appears that says "Insecure FTP connection", click OK to continue)
  3. On right side, look for the "Remote Site" section > "data" directory (double click) and a directory should appear below.
  4. Next, in the upper menu> choose Transfer> Manual Transfer.
  5. A new modal window will appear (see below).
  In the email/ticket you received from BrightMove that contained the FTP link to your attachments and a password. In the URL there is a portion of the link you'll need to copy and paste into the Manual Transfer screen (shown above).
  The emailed link looks like this:
  6. Copy the numerical_attachments.zip portion of the link (highlighted below).
  7. Paste the copied portion into 2 places on the manual transfer screen:
  a) Local File section (left side)> File > paste after desired folder location.
  b) Remote file section (right side) > File> paste into empty box.
  8. Click the "Start transfer immediately" checkbox at the bottom of the modal.
  9. Click OK button. ​The files will then be transferred. This may take a couple minutes to complete. The bottom of the screen should show a transfer in progress and the top of the screen should show the starting download/file transfer successful/ etc.
  After the attachments download has finished, you will have a zip file that needs a password to be opened.

  Zapier allows you to connect the apps you know and love to build workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and save time.
  Note for RPO: Due to Zapier's architecture this integration is only possible using an API Key for a licensed user on each individual account. This means a parent user cannot create Zaps for child accounts and must use a separate login/license on the child account.
  If you do not have a Zapier account, please set one up prior to attempting this integration.

  Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (e.g. BrightMove pages, HTML pages, images) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache. Clearing it occasionally allows BrightMove to load fresh again which may enable additional features that it wasn’t loading previously and can also free up space on your computer’s hard drive if it's running low. Since every browser is different, the following sections will outline the steps involved in clearing the cache for several popular web browsers.
  There may be times you need your browser to forget previous settings or views inside BrightMove without clearing all your history.
  We have created a new link inside BrightMove to allow you to do that. Simply go to My Quick Links>Settings> Local History. Click it once and then it will give you a fresh screen view.
  Example: After a new release, you are not seeing the submittal status column on a job. Go to Settings and click the Local History link, then go back to the job. The view will be fixed going forward.

  Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an authentication method that requires a user to provide two verification factors to gain access to your BrightMove Account. BrightMove has added a One-Time Password option verified through an app on your smartphone. The one-time password in this case is a 6 digit security code.
  Adding additional verification factors decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack. Usernames and passwords are vulnerable to brute force attacks and can be stolen by third parties, especially if a username and password combination is reused on multiple different sites.

  How to setup and manage Office 365 Email & Calendar Integration
  BrightSync is a feature of BrightMove that can be used by full users.  Hiring manager and client contact accounts do not support BrightSync.  There is no additional software to purchase or install to use BrightSync, but an account with Office 365 is required.  BrightSync seamlessly integrates with Outlook through Office 365, streamlining the management of contacts, calendars, and applicant data.
  This feature allows you to import your organization's GAL directly into the ATS, ensuring that all essential contacts are readily available within the system. This reduces manual data entry and keeps information synchronized. As new contacts are managed within the GAL in Office 365, webhooks are used to keep your ATS GAL in sync. Whenever records are created, updated or deleted, webhooks are executed on the Office 365 platform to update your company's GAL within ATS.
  : With Contact Push, you can transfer applicant or client contacts from the ATS into Outlook effortlessly. This ensures consistency across platforms, making it easier to manage your professional relationships.
  : This feature synchronizes activities between your ATS and Outlook Calendar. Updates made in either system are reflected in both, helping you stay organized and reducing the risk of missed events.
  : This functionality enables you to extract candidate and job information directly from individual Outlook messages. By navigating through your inbox, you can parse the contents of messages and attachments into the ATS, simplifying data entry.
  : Inbox Auto Parse automates the scanning of your Outlook mailbox and attachments for recent applicant records, updating them in the ATS. This automation ensures that your applicant data remains current without manual effort.
  : When you send emails with BrightMove using
  through BrightSync and Office 365, you will have access to engagement and delivery data with the recipient. However, by deactivating
  , your emails will be saved in your
  folder in Outlook. We call this Sent Items Visibility. Alternatively, enabling Send with BrightMove (Duality Mode) allows messages to be sent without routing through Office 365, giving you additional visibility and metrics around email communications.
  To setup BrightSync, you will need to configure a connection to Office 365. To do this, you will need to get your Tenant ID from your email admin.
  BrightSync will not connect if you have strict permissions setup in Microsoft Entra that require admin consent to connect with BrightMove. In this case, you will need to grant your users the ability to

  Logout and Log back in to ATS. This will reset your session with your Office365 credentials.
  You will then be redirected to the Office 365 page where you will sign in and grant the permissions that are requested. Once granted, you will be redirected back into BrightMove to complete the process.
  There are 2 configuration areas within ATS that need to be enabled in order for calendar synchronization to work.
  when a candidate is moved in the submittal workflow, you can configure the status change to trigger a calendar sync.
  when an activity is performed on a candidate, you can configure the activity type to trigger a calendar sync.
  Go to Settings > Submittal Workflow and toggle the submittal activity types you wish to be able to sync with Office 365. By enabling these switches, you will instruct ATS to sync events with this type to your calendar.

  are WCAG 2.0 AAA compliant which is the highest compliance level possible. Learn how to make your portal and website WCAG 2.0 AAA compliant.
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photo-sensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.
  Some elements put in place to accomplish AAA compliance are:
  Darkened text
  Increased contrast on pages
  Label, input, link and image elements are tagged properly for screen readers.
  A couple things to note that should not be used in portals as they are out of WCAG 2.0 AAA Compliance are:
  You can only have one Job Search section on the portal. If you currently have multiple, you should reduce them to one.
  Cannot use the social sharing icons below job descriptions. This is a company preference and must be disabled.
  You must first get your website compliant and then you can notify BrightMove Support (
  ) that you want your portal branded/ re-branded to match. Standard BrightMove portal branding is $200 per portal.
  There is a free accessibility checker tool for the Chrome browser you can use to determine if your portal is AAA compliant or if areas of your website need to be addresses internally to achieve this.
  Please note that there are errors and warnings visible within the checker tool.
  Warnings are not anything to take action on. These are items that may become an error in the future but are not currently. You can disregard these as BrightMove managed as many warnings as we could so those remaining are non-critical.
  Errors are items that you need to address to achieve compliance. Remember, if your website is not compliant, your branded portal won't be either.

  The "Build an Ad Hoc Report" guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on creating customized reports tailored to specific needs within BrightMove. Ad Hoc Reports are built on top of the powerful
  , our advanced business intelligence and analytics platform. If you have specific reporting, analytics or business intelligence needs, our support team can help with additional info on Wisdom.
  This article outlines the steps to access the ad hoc reporting tool, how to specify subject areas, select data fields, and apply filters to extract relevant information from your database. Subject areas are the types of data contained within a report. Users can also learn how to customize the report’s layout, add calculated fields, and save or export the report for future reference or sharing.
  By following the detailed instructions, users can quickly generate insightful reports that aid in data-driven decision-making and enhance overall recruitment strategies.

  Click

  Select a Subject Area, Title, Max Number of Results, and if you want your report to be public or private. The Subject Area is the type of data you'd like to include in the report, like Candidates, Jobs, Submittals, etc.
  In the Fields tab select all of the columns you want in your report. You can adjust the order by dragging the filter with the orange double sided arrow.
  The Groupings tab allows the report to be divided by a like term of the field(s) you specify.
  The Filters tab is where you will define your report parameters.
  The Sorting tab allows you to sort fields by ascending or descending order.
  When you have completed your report click
  at the top right.
  There are some fields that you might be expecting to see within the report output.  There are some fields which are not able to be filtered on or displayed in reports.  Our reporting system does not allow for the display, filtering, sorting or grouping on fields of CLOB data types.
  A CLOB (Character Large OBject) is part of the SQL:1999 standard data types. It is a collection of character data in a database management system, usually stored in a separate location that is referenced in the table itself.  We use CLOBs to text, memo or long character fields.  Because of the use of this data type within the application, certain fields cannot be reported on within the reporting service.
  Examples of some fields that meet this criteria are:
  Candidate Resume
  Candidate Notes
  Job Descriptions (Public and Private)
  Job Required Skills
  Job Notes
  Submittal Activity Notes
  Client Contact / Hiring Manager Notes
  In order to view the contents of these fields, please use the application's native viewer.
  The Functions Tab allows you to execute SUM, COUNT, and AVERAGE functions within your reported data. Use the following guide when adding functions to your report:
  SUM will total rows that are grouped (Select the Grouping tab to group rows together)
  AVERAGE will average the number by group
  COUNT will count the number of results returned
  Names and activity types will generally only work with the COUNT function applied
  The Schedule Tab allows you to set a schedule for when you want your custom report to run automatically. This setting will default to Never, but can be changed to run Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly with specific days and times configured within each Recurrence Pattern.
  You can also add additional recipients that are in your BrightMove account by selecting the green plus sign.
  From the reports page you can filter the available reports with the subject area drop down. View all reports, private reports, or public reports by selecting the respective toggle. To view the report you can either press the view button or the title of the report. Once you are viewing your report you can export it by clicking
  at the top right.
  To copy an existing report first select an existing report to view. Click
  at the top right to access the Copy Modal. Rename the report (Default is "Copy of -Report Name-") and select if it will be public or private, then click save.

  At this time, data is loaded from the on-demand BrightMove ATS database into the BrightMove analytics database once per day. This process starts at 7:00 AM EST.
  If you refresh your data in Power BI Desktop each day, do so after 8:00 AM EST to get all of your latest data from the previous day.
  The dataset refresh in Power BI Cloud currently has a bug (as of 11/06/2015) when refreshing online OData sources. We have a bug report on file with Microsoft, and will update the users and this document once they have resolved this bug.
  Once the bug is resolved by Microsoft, you can schedule your daily refresh in Power BI Cloud, and at that point there will be no need to refresh from Power BI Desktop and then Publish to the Cloud.

  In this article, you will learn how to setup your company's submittal workflow.
  The Submittal Workflow is the configuration within ATS that implements recruiting process your candidate will go through from initial application through to hire or declined. It is a critical configuration within the platform as it defines the standard recruiting process for the entire company. There are a few critical choices you need to make when setting up your submittal workflow.
  . It controls the visualization and functionality of the view of candidates who have been submitted to a job on the BrightFlow tab, and it provides an efficient way to manage candidates. See the BrightFlow setup article for specific information about this feature.
  Each BrightMove account includes a stand workflow. You can use this one, create your own custom one, or add in additional statuses to the standard one.
  By default, the BrightMove Submittal workflow is open meaning that a candidate can move from any status to any other status. This is an open workflow. If you prefer you can also lock your workflow and require candidates to go through each different stage. There are pluses and minus to each different method. You can also pick something in the middle and require some important steps, but leave others open. The best part is you can change your mind later and

  In this article, you will learn how to assign activities to statuses within your company's workflow.
  Your company's submittal workflow settings are located within the main Settings screen under the Submittal Workflow link.
  To assign or update the assignment of submittal activity types within a given submittal status, start by selecting the Edit button for the status you want to work within. There are several tabs at the top of the status' settings window, and you will want to select the Activity Types tab to make your changes. There are two settings for each available activity type in the lists: Hidden and Visible.
  For any submittal activity that you want accessible while assigning your current submittal status, check the bubble in the Visible column. Conversely, any activity that should not be available needs to have the Hidden bubble selected. If you would like all activities to either be Hidden or Visible, select the corresponding Mark All button at the top of each column.
  The Mass column denotes which activities are available when performing a Mass Status change action.
  Activities can be sorted from within the Sort Activity Types tab. Use the arrows to move an activity up or down in the list or drag and drop an activity precisely where you want it to be.

CONTENT:
  Candidate Experience Portals V3 provides a new and intuitive way to implement your portal into your own website with a simple script! Here we will discuss how to add a V3 portal to a website and a WordPress site.
  BrightMove Portals have been redesigned to give the customer more control over where and how jobs are displayed and can be embedded into any website with little to no knowledge of web design.
  First, open the HTML page you want to edit and find where you want your portal to display. We've used boilerplate HTML 5 below as an example below.
  All Version 3 portals will have the Share & Embed option available in the More dropdown.
  Currently V3 portals are active beta, so please contact our Support team to upgrade your portal version to V3.
  You can place embed snippet
  inside the
  tag. In this example it will be above the Contact paragraph.
  The final html with the embed script should look something like this:
  Which will render your new V3 Portal within your html page!
  There is no step four.
  Embedding V3 Portals into a WordPress site is the same procedure as above, except instead of modifying the website html directly, you will want to create a new Page with a Slug. In this example we have created a new page titled
  at
  with the page title Career Portal.
  You will need new redirect rules for the direct entry into the Careers page from outside of WordPress, think direct link to Jobs. Install the Redirection Plugin here:
  Follow the basic installation instructions provided by the plugin author, and upload the following json file. Replace {YOUR-CAREERS-SITE} with your careers site, eg. '/careers'
  Your installation is complete!
  Happy Hiring,

  How to post a single job to multiple search locations on Indeed
  Marketing Locations is an optional job field that allows you to post
  on Indeed and your Job Portal.
  This helps your job reach a wider audience when it is available in multiple cities, regions, or is a
  position. Marketing Locations also lets you manage a single pool of candidates in one job profile, instead of posting multiple jobs for each location.
  If your job is
  or
  , do not use Marketing Locations. Instead, post the job with a single, primary location.
  For more details, see:
  in the
  article.
  Please follow these guidelines to ensure your jobs post correctly to Indeed:
  Indeed defaults to a 25-mile search radius. You should not add Marketing Locations (or multiple zip codes) that fall within this radius.
  BrightMove will automatically exclude overlapping locations from the feed to help comply — but this relies on a valid zip code being present in your job profile.
  If your job is
  , note this in your job description and list surrounding municipalities you want to target.
  Only select Marketing Locations where the job is truly available. If the job does not cover a particular Marketing Location, do not select it.
  (Choosing inaccurate locations may result in Indeed rejecting the post.)
  ⚠️
  You can select Marketing Locations in three ways:
  (defaults to a 25-mile minimum radius)
  (enter county name and state)
  (enter city name)
  Once you choose a search method, a list of available locations will display. Select the locations you want to assign to the job.
  To clear your selections, click the
  button.After you have selected your search method, a list of
  will display. Select the locations you wish to assign to the job. To clear the results to select a different Marketing Location, there is a
  button next to the locations list.
  You can select a maximum of
  per job. If you select more than 50, you will see a warning message. The first 50 locations selected will be applied to your job.

  Barriers to completing an application are reduced and the number of applicants increases, according to Indeed.com.
  Basic Qualifications and UDF's assigned to your default portal will be included in the Indeed application.
  This feature is defaulted "on" for all of our customers. However, you can opt-out if you want your Applicants to continue to be directed to your BrightMove candidate experience portal, rather than stay on Indeed to complete an application.
  You can opt-out yourself in Settings> Manage Your Company> Preferences, inside BrightMove.

  How to Customize the Candidate Experience Portal with CSS
  This advanced guide is designed for web developers who want to customize the appearance and layout of BrightMove's Candidate Experience Portal. You can override default styles using CSS to match your company's branding and design requirements.
  Best for extensive customizations or when you need to maintain styles separately.
  Create a custom CSS file with your style overrides
  Save the file on your company website
  Note the full URL to your CSS file
  Add this link tag to the
  section of your portal
  HTML:
  Best for overriding a few specific styles without creating a separate file.
  If you just want to override a handful of styles, you can use the embedded style sheet solution in the HTML you upload to BrightMove. Just add this in the <head> tag of your HTML.
  In this example the CSS style is for the highlight color when mousing over a job on the portal. The color has been changed to "#f27789 color hex" or a rose color.
  Here is an example of what is inserted to accomplish this change.
  The original css style information is found in the below default CSS file.
  BrightMove offers a clean and crisp standard career site look and feel. Here is the default CSS:
  To make BQ's that are side-by-side in 2 columns appear stacked vertically instead, add this to your portal. In the "Company Page Section HTML" box in your portal, paste the below code into the bottom of that box.
  This code will hide the "Portal Home" option on Portal home page (in the gray bar). In the "Company Page Section HTML" box in your portal, paste the below code into the bottom of that box.
  This code will hide the "Create Profile" option on Portal home page (in the gray bar). In the "Company Page Section HTML" box in your portal, paste the below code into the bottom of that box.
  This will make UDF's stack vertically rather than side by side in the application. In the "Company Page Section HTML" box in your portal, paste the below code into the bottom of that box.
  This will allow you to adjust the font size for the custom Terms and Conditions section of your portal settings. Please place the following code in the Main Section Wrapper area below the ||SECTION_CONTENT|| information and adjust the font size number accordingly.
  This will correct if headers are small and right justified to make them larger and left justified. In the Company Page Section HTML box in your portal, paste this code within the body code.
  In the Company Page Section HTML box in your portal, paste this code within the body code. Affects the TimeCard section.
  Place below code after the <body> tag in the company html section.
  You need to add this to the Main Section Wrapper box within your portal settings.
  You need to add content to the portal, i.e. ||PORTAL_DATA||, and just change Portal Casa to the label you'd like.
  You need to add content to the portal, i.e. ||PORTAL_DATA||, and just change Create Profile Custom to the label you'd like.
  Place this code in the <head></head> section of your html.
  Place this code right above the </body> end tag of your html.
  In the Company Page Section HTML box in your portal, paste this code within the body code.
  Create a new portal configuration within your account for testing changes
  Test all customizations in a staging environment first
  Keep a backup of your original portal HTML
  Use specific CSS selectors to avoid unintended changes
  Comment your custom CSS for future reference
  CSS styles: Add to
  box in portal settings
  JavaScript: Add after
  tag or before
  tag as specified
  External links: Add to
  section of your portal HTML
  Check CSS syntax for errors
  Ensure selectors match BrightMove's class names exactly
  Use
  declaration if needed to override default styles
  Clear browser cache after making changes
  Verify script placement (most scripts go before
  tag)
  Check browser console for JavaScript errors
  Ensure jQuery is loaded before your custom scripts
  Test on different screen sizes and devices
  Check for conflicting CSS rules
  Validate HTML markup

  How to assign knock out questions to a job
  Basic Qualifications are custom knockout questions that you can ask your candidates when they apply to jobs. In BrightMove, qualification questions can be configured to appear on all jobs or only specific jobs. The "Show on Portal" setting determines whether a question appears across all jobs listed on the portal or can be selectively assigned. In this article, we will go through the process of assigning BQ's to specific jobs rather than posting to all jobs on the portal.
  When you are creating a job for the first time, at any point you can choose to assign specific BQ's to this job. Specifically, BQ's that are not already posted onto the Portal. To avoid a question being applied to all jobs unintentionally, you should deselect the "Show on Portal" option when creating the qualification question. Once a job has submittals, you can no longer add BQ's to that job, so it is important that you add the BQ's when you are creating the job. In cases where a job already has submittals and you need to add qualification questions, you would need to recreate the job position.
  To do this you can follow these steps:
  From the job profile, click on the More button in the top right. Select Basic Qualifications.
  A new page will open. From here, click Add Questions in the top right.
  A drop down menu will appear that reads Search Questions. Any available questions will be listed here, simply click on the one you wish to assign and then click Assign. You can repeat this process to add more if you wish.
  Keep in mind that only BQ's that did not have the selection for Show on Portal selected can be assigned to specific Jobs. If the "Show on Portal" option is enabled for a question, it will automatically appear on every job. Once a qualification question is unmarked as "Show on Portal," it will no longer appear on any jobs and will need to be manually assigned to the desired jobs.
  For Reference:
  Always double-check the "Show on Portal" setting when creating a new qualification question.
  Plan the assignment of questions before jobs receive submittals to avoid recreating job postings.
  Regularly review the questions assigned to active jobs to ensure they align with current hiring needs.

  This will send automated emails to the specific users of the job for which this submittal has been set.
  For example, here are a few scenarios you could use this feature for:
  Automatically send an email to an applicant thanking them for their application for a specific job
  Automatically send an email to a Manager alerting them to a new submittal to review for a specific job
  Automatically send an email to a Sourcer letting them know the job has been filled
  Automatically send an email to a Sales Rep letting them know an offer has been accepted
  To send automated emails, you will need to assign a

Statuses can have multiple templates associated to them, but only one for each user type per status. That is, you cannot set more than one Communication Template a user type and status combination.
  To assign the

CONTENT:
  The submittal workflow is a roadmap of the journey your candidate takes from applying to the job to hired or declined. There are several different options for you that we will cover in this article.
  - The order in which the statuses appear in the Status dropdown. This also determines the completion percentage
  - The internal name for your status.
  - If you do not have manager logins on your account, you can skip this column. If you do have manager logins on your account, then the
  toggle allows you to control which candidates the manager can see. If the candidate is in a status that has the
  , the manager can view the candidate when logging in. If the candidate is in a status that has
  , the manager can not see that candidate when logging in. This is a good way to hide declined candidates or candidates who have not been screened yet, allowing the manager to focus on the higher-quality candidates.
  - Turn this on to designate a status for placed or hired for candidates
  - Turn this on to designate a status for declined candidates
  - In BrightMove, sending a candidate profile to a manager to review is called a sendout. When you perform a sendout, the candidate status will be updated to whatever status you mark as
  . Only mark one status as
  for this function to work correctly.
  - BrightMove has a smart report called the Time to Hire report. This report will calculate the time between the open date and placement or close date for the job. If you do not want a particular candidate status to count as part of your Time to Hire (TTH), turn off the
  column.
  - If you do not have Recruiter Analytics on your account, you can skip this column. If you do have Recruiter Analytics, there is a section for quality candidates. Mark a status or multiple statuses as
  here to have them counted as a quality candidate in the Recruiter Analytics report.

  Troubleshooting Job Posting Issues Between BrightMove ATS and Indeed
  Indeed has a policy that all staffing companies must have a sponsored visibility to post jobs. If you have not already done so, please contact Indeed support to inquire how to do this.
  For direct employers, Indeed does not currently require sponsorship to post jobs.
  If your job postings from BrightMove aren't appearing on Indeed as expected, here are specific troubleshooting steps for BrightMove users:
  1.
  Navigate to the job in question
  Select the Job Board Posting tab
  Confirm that you see a green check next to Indeed (a green checkmark means the job is included in the Indeed feed, a green person with a check means applications are being received)
  2.
  Ensure "Publish to Web" option is selected for the specific job
  Check that your
  is complete and accurate in BrightMove
  Verify your
  settings are properly configured within
  (while this won't affect posting, it could adversely impact application rate)
  3.
  Review job titles for Indeed compatibility (avoid special characters or all caps)
  Ensure job descriptions meet Indeed's content guidelines
  Check that required fields like location and job type are properly filled out
  Remove any screening questions that aren't supported by Indeed
  Don't continue to resubmit jobs by changing the date; Indeed sees this as spam.
  4.
  Check the job feed logs by clicking View Logs on the Job Board Posting tab
  Make sure you use the proper date and job board filters to search the logs
  Staffing companies are required to sponsor jobs for visibility.  Speak with your Indeed representative if you believe this relates to your company.
  Allow 24-48 hours for job postings to appear on Indeed
  : Ensure job categories in BrightMove map correctly to Indeed's classification system
  : Check if there have been any recent
  that might have affected the feed

  BrightFlow is a Kanban style implementation of the submittal workflow. It is a high-level view of statuses that can be categorized into user generated
  . These swim lanes are also often referred to as
  . Adding an additional layer to your submittal workflow has a notable increase in recruiter efficiency. BrightFlow provides a clean UI that packages your statuses into highly customizable fields for easy viewing and tracking.
  Status tiles with a green background are Placement statuses, Blue background are Submitted to Client statuses (Sendout), Red are Declined/Rejected statuses and gray are all others in-between.
  The column header colors are customizable by you!
  To access the setup page navigate to the settings menu from your quick links and select BrightFlow Setup in the Company Settings section.
  To create a new Swim Lane press the Add Swim Lane button on the top right. This will open a configuration modal that allows you to pick the name, text color, background color, and border color. There is no limit to the number of Swim Lanes you can create.
  When you are structuring BrightFlow keep in mind that you must assign each status to a lane for candidates assigned to that status to be visible or for candidates to be moved into that status from another lane.
  Don't create individual lanes for each status. They are designed to be groupings or categories to hold statuses within.
  To edit an existing Swim Lane click on the name of the Swim Lane you wish to edit or the pencil icon beside it. To adjust the location of the Swim Lane you can click the left and right arrow keys. To delete a Swim Lane press the Trash Can icon. The number to the left of the Trash Can displays how many statuses are in that lane.
  All of your statuses will be unassigned by default. Placement statuses have a green background, declined statuses have a red background, and all other statuses will be grey.
  To move a status into a Swim Lane simply drag and drop a card from either the unassigned pool or a currently assigned lane.
  To save your changes select the Save button at the top right. To disregard your changes you can select
  Back to Settings instead.

  The job is a mix of remote and in-office work. Example: Three days work-from-home, two days in-office each week.
  The job can be performed from anywhere outside of a company office or travel assignment. Example: Home, coworking space, cafe, or even internationally.
  The job is performed from the employee’s home. It does not require any in-office presence or travel.

  Learn how and when to use the Secure (HTTPS) Protocol for your portal.
  BrightMove Candidate Experience Portals are defaulted to a non-secure HTTP protocol, but the option exists to convert the career portals to use the secure protocol (HTTPS). The reason for this is that a vast majority of customer portals are branded in such a way that if we did enforce HTTPS on portal activity, we would be invoking a large quantity of candidates facing security warnings. With the ever growing need for greater online security, our development team has implemented an option for testing and eventually enabling the HTTPS protocol for your portal(s).
  If you are unable to secure the resources for your career portal, please reach out to the BrightMove Support staff. We offer a hosting service for $500 that will make any currently branded resources secure.
  Enabling the secure HTTPS protocol with non-secure HTTP branded website resources will cause display issues within your career portal. Always test your portal and correct any issues before enabling the secure HTTPS protocol. Follow these steps to enable HTTPS on your portal:

  Learn what CNAMES are and how to configure them within BrightMove.
  A
  (abbreviated as
  ) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) which maps one domain name to another. CNAME records can be used to customize the visible URL(s) for your account's portal(s). You can think of a CNAME record as an alias for your account's portal page. If you have a CNAME for "jobs.mycompany.com" that points at the portal domain (ejob.bz), candidates will see the "jobs.mycompany.com" URL within their browser instead of our standard ejob.bz/ATS URL.
  For further information regarding CNAME records, click
  .
  The main purpose for the CNAME enhancement is to allow your account's portal sitemap to contain the URLs of your domain. This will allow you to register the portal sitemap with Google Webmaster Tools to allow Google to crawl your job postings on the portal for use with Google Jobs. When a CNAME record is configured, our standard ejob.bz portal URL prefix will be replaced with your custom URL and will display the custom CNAME in parenthesis beside your career portal title in the career portal settings screen.
  Within your Candidate Experience Portal settings, you can select the title link or Edit button of the career portal that you would like to update. This will open that specific experience portal's settings, and you can add in your custom CNAME into the field provided. Once added, select the Save button to save the changes.
  If you would like a CNAME put in place for your BrightMove job portal:
  1. Notify BrightMove Support at
  or via Live Chat you wish to create a portal CNAME. The fee for this service is $600.00.
  2. Once BrightMove has completed the needed tasks on our end, we'll then let you know that your website administrator can now complete the CNAME process on their end.
  CNAME configuration will need to be done from your personal or company domain website administrative tools and should be completed by a website administrator if available. Common domain registrars include GoDaddy.com, Bluehost.com, HostGator.com, NameCheap.com, InMotion Hosting, and Register.com. To help assist in your custom CNAME record configuration, select the quick link for your domain registrar's help page below.

CONTENT:
  We are going to review every aspect of what a Job Approver is. Who can be a Job Approver? How do you Manage Multiple Job Approvers? How do you assign Job Approver Delegates? How do you Approve a Job that is awaiting your approval? These topics and more will be covered in this article. This will be your go-to place for all things Job Approver related.
  A Job Approver is any licensed BrightMove user that has the authority to review a Job listing before it is posted by a Hiring Manager. Typically this will be another Hiring Manager, Recruiter, or an Administrator. This will help ensure that only authorized jobs are posted.
  The quick answer? Yes, unless you've set up
  . This function prevents jobs from being posted unless they go through the proper channels first. Job Approvers are assigned directly to Hiring Manager profile that they will approving jobs for, in the order in which they will be giving their approval for the job; this ensures that any job created by that Manager will be reviewed and authorized by their Approver before being posted. It is worth noting, that Recruiters and Administrators are assumed to be Job Approvers for themselves and do not require Job Approvers be assigned to authorize their jobs; for this reason, if a Recruiter and/or Administrator creates a job, approval is automatic and will not follow the approval process outlined above for that Hiring Manager.
  Hiring Managers by default can be selected as Job Approvers for other Hiring Managers. Recruiters and Administrators must be marked as a Job Approver before they can be selected to do so. To mark a Recruiter or Administrator users as an Approver, follow the steps below:
  Go to Settings>Employees.
  Click on the user's name you wish to make a Job Approver.
  Click the Toggle under Job Approver to toggle it on and mark this user as a Job Approver.
  Navigate to a hiring manager's profile that you would like to configure Job Approvals for.
  Find the
  field on the left-hand side.
  Click the
  (+) icon to assign them an approver.
  Click the plus sign (+) to the right of the Job Approver you wish to assign to this Hiring Manager. This will move them to the right column. Continue adding any additional Job Approvers who will be apart of the approval sequence for this Hiring Manager. You can use the up/down arrows to the left of their names (once added) to properly sequence them.
  Click the
  button
  You have successfully added a Job Approver/approval sequence to this Hiring Manager for any jobs opened by them moving forward. Congratulations!
  In reference to the sequencing above, the order of your approvers in an approval chain is very important. This determines the order of who approves the job, starting from the
  at the top and ending at the
  at the bottom. In the example above, Robin Recrooder will be required to Approve the Job first, followed by any subsequent Job Approvers. Once all approvers have approved the job in order, the job will be ready to post.
  It is important to note that this Approver chain
  be followed; keep in mind the following:
  If the approval sequence for a Hiring Manager changes (the order of the Job Approvers) before a job has been fully approved, the job must be re-created once a new approval sequence has been put in place for that Hiring Manager. This usually happens when a Job Approver leaves the company or is removed as a Job Approver.
  If for some reason an Approver is unable to approve a Job, you can assign Approver Delegates that can approve in their absence. This is most commonly used for when a Job Approver is out on PTO.
  The Steps for assigning Job Approver Delegates is the same for All users including Hiring Managers. Let's take a look.
  Navigate to Settings>Delegate Approvers.
  Click the Add Delegate button in the upper right.
  Use the Approver field to locate the Approver you wish to assign as a delegate.
  Select the date range for when you wish this Approver to be able to Approve jobs on your behalf.

CONTENT:
  We provide a high level overview of how to configure SPF records within your company's email server. If you are not using our integration with Outlook, you will want to set up an SPF Record to ensure your emails are successfully delivered to candidates and hiring managers.
  “include:_spf.brightmove.com”
  Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect and prevent the forging of sender addresses during the delivery of email. This helps prevent spam by requiring the sender to prove they are legitimately allowed to send email for a specific domain name. An SPF record is a configuration within the domain name owner's DNS zone file that authorizes email to be delivered on their behalf.
  To create an SPF record for a domain:
  Log in to the DNS administrative console for your domain (for example, GoDaddy, Network Solutions, etc.).
  Locate the page from which you can update the DNS records.
  You may need to enable advanced settings.
  Create a TXT record containing this text:
  ​
  Publishing an SPF record that uses
  instead of
  may result in delivery problems.
  ​
  To authorize an additional mail server, add the server's IP address before just before the
  argument using the format
  or
  . (See
  for more details on the SPF format.)
  If your registrar also requires a host setting (such as @), see the
  list for precise instructions.
  Save your changes.
  Keep in mind that changes to DNS records may take up to 48 hours to propagate throughout the Internet.
  : Multiple SPF records are not recommended and may cause delivery and spam classification issues. See
  for more information.

  Learn how to select Candidate, Client, Manager, and Job profiles for mass deletion.
  The first step to allow a user the rights to mass delete profile is found within the Security settings. A list of security preferences can be enabled or disabled for any given security role. The following example shows all of the necessary security preferences needed in order to control the mass deletion ability within a user's account.
  In order to mass delete a list of candidates, a user will first need to utilize the Candidate Power Search to locate the profiles. Once located and selected, the Choose an Option for List menu can be used to locate the Mass Delete Candidate option at the very bottom of the drop-down. Select the option (as shown below) and then select the Go button to execute the mass deletion.
  Once the candidate profiles are deleted from the power search, they will remain in a 'soft' deleted state viewable within the Candidate Recycle Bin. This screen is accessed from your left-hand navigation bar under the main Candidates section. To permanently delete a list of candidates, select all that apply and use the Delete Permanently button displayed in the middle of your screen (see below).

  Once the client profiles are deleted from the power search, they will remain in a 'soft' deleted state viewable within the Client Recycle Bin. This screen is accessed from your left-hand navigation bar under the main Clients section. To permanently delete a list of clients, select all that apply and use the Delete Permanently button displayed in the middle of your screen (see below).
  In order to mass delete a list of managers, a user will first need to utilize the Manager Power Search to locate the profiles.

  How to setup and manage 3rd party vendors who supply applicants
  BrightMove's vendor management system allows you to work efficiently with external recruiters and staffing agencies. We call these external agencies
  .  With the Vendor Management feature, you can enable these external agencies to submit candidates and track submissions with your company.  This article explains how to set up vendors, create vendor portals, and manage the candidate submission process.
  Log in to your BrightMove account
  Go to
  >
  Click the
  button in the top right corner
  BrightMove offers two methods for vendor configuration:
  This method is great for companies who use Vendors but just want the basic Vendor portal setup that BrightMove has always offered.  You can simply enter a Vendor name, Vendor Contact name,
  fields, and click Submit.  This will allow you to assign the Vendor to jobs.  The Vendor will log in to their Vendor portal to view Open jobs assigned to them and submit Candidates.
  Simple Method will not send notifications to the Vendor when a job they are assigned to is created or updated. The Vendor can subscribe to the Vendor portal RSS feed for this purpose.  If you want notifications sent, please see Interactive Method below.
  This method is great for companies who use Vendors and want extra functionality for your Vendors. You can customize and send automatic email notifications to Vendor contacts upon Job creation/Job updates. This method also allows the Vendor to parse resumes & submit to a job at same time via a vendor-specific parser email address.  The Vendor name will be automatically set in the Vendor field on the Applicant profile when their inbound email domain matches the domain's entered in their Vendor profile.  The email domains field is a white list feature that allows you to set what domains can email this address.
  Go to
  >
  Click on the vendor name
  From the
  menu, select Edit or Delete
  Go to
  >
  Click
  in the upper right corner
  Name the portal (typically the vendor name)
  Select
  as the portal type
  Set a portal password if desired
  Scroll down to the
  section
  Click the
  to move the vendor name to the box on the right
  This will filter jobs to only show that vendor's assigned positions
  Scroll up and click
  In the
  column for this portal
  Enable the sections you want vendors to access
  The
  pane is recommended to allow vendors to view all their assigned jobs
  The Vendor Management features works with the
  feature.  You can setup a communication template for the Vendor user type, for specific communications you have with these types of business partners.
  Go to
  >
  Click
  in the upper right corner
  Complete the template name and subject
  Leave the template as
  Under
  , select
  Under
  , select
  from the dropdown
  Create the email body using substitution fields shown on the right
  During job creation or when editing an existing job
  Highlight the vendor name(s) you want to assign
  Click
  to save
  must be checked
  box must be checked
  These settings ensure the job appears on vendor portals
  Job appears on vendor portal; vendors should subscribe to RSS feed for updates
  Vendor receives email notification about job creation/updates
  Vendor emails resume to your company's email parser address
  Subject line format:
  (where BMID is the BrightMove Job ID)
  Vendor should remove email signatures and previous email chains from the body
  With Interactive Method setup, the vendor is automatically assigned in the Candidate Vendor field
  Vendors can still submit candidates through the portal using the "Create Profile and Apply to Job" button, but email parsing is more efficient.
  Access
  Select
  from the filter drop down
  Select the vendor(s) you want to search for
  Export results to Excel for reporting (if needed)
  The Vendors section may be hidden in your Security Role settings
  Account Admin should enable "Access Vendor Module" in Security Role settings
  Verify you've used the Interactive Method for setup
  Confirm the notification email address is correct
  Check that an appropriate email template is assigned

  Offers flexibility for custom questions beyond standard job application forms, such as portfolio submissions, availability, or specific role-related inquiries.
  2.
  Applicant Form
  Capture critical information for new hires, like personal details, emergency contacts, and tax forms (e.g., W-4).
  Simplifies onboarding by automating form assignments based on hire status, reducing manual tracking.
  3.
  Applicant Form
  Provide assessments, skill tests, or behavioral surveys to evaluate candidate suitability for specific roles.
  Automates the evaluation process, gathering real-time responses that can be used to update candidate profiles.
  4.
  Applicant Form
  Gather signatures or acknowledgments for company policies, privacy agreements, or nondisclosure agreements.
  Ensures regulatory compliance and maintains a record of signed acknowledgments in the candidate’s file.
  5.
  Applicant Form
  Use forms to gather feedback during the recruiting process or collect insights from employees who are leaving.
  Helps improve processes and identify areas of growth or retention opportunities by collecting structured feedback.
  6.
  Applicant Form
  Centralize the collection of references, by asking candidates for who to contact.
  Saves time by eliminating manual data entry for recruiters.
  7.
  Applicant Form
  Use for career fairs, webinars, or job information sessions to collect participant feedback.
  Makes data collection easy for recruiting events and can help in post-event follow-up for potential candidates.
  Each of these use cases is designed to enhance the candidate and recruiter experience, enabling tailored, efficient, and compliant data gathering across recruitment stages.
  BrightForms can be seamlessly integrated into your existing Submittal Workflow. You can have a BrightForm be kicked off to a Candidate upon entering a submittal status and upon Candidate completion of the form, their submittal status can be changed to a status of your choosing.
  BrightForms are a perfect onboarding tool.
  Pricing is $29.00 per published form, per month. However if you will need many forms we offer an unlimited form package for $99 per month.
  You will subscribe to how many Published BrightForms you want each month. This will allow you to publish up to that amount each month. This is an excellent value since you only pay a monthly fee for the form, not the number of times it is utilized.
  You do not pay for BrightForms while in Draft status.
  Pros:
  Enhanced candidate experience through tailored forms.
  Streamlined onboarding with automated workflows.
  Access to ready-made community forms.
  Cons:
  Additional costs for published forms.
  Requires time to design and implement custom forms.

  The back office module uses an advanced scheduler to generate appropriate invoices and line items for your AR/GL system. During the course of business operations, your teams will perform activities that should be billed for. We refer to this as fee realization. Fees are realized during the course of business as pay lines, and once they are ready to be invoiced, an invoice is generated. Invoices are generated by invoking the Generate Invoice operation within the back office module.
  Pay lines are realized fees that have not yet been invoiced or paid. Pay lines can have the following statuses. The process of converting a pay line to a line item within an invoice is invoicing.
  Scheduled
  A pay line that has not yet been invoiced and has an effective date in the future.
  An invoice and invoice line item will not be generated for pay lines in a scheduled status.
  Pending
  A pay line that has not yet been invoiced and has an effective date that is today or in the past.
  An invoice line item will be generated for pay lines in a pending status.
  Snoozed
  A pay line that in pending, but has been put on hold for an exceptional reason. Snoozed line items
  be included in the batch.
  Snoozed line items can be un-snoozed, which will release them to be included in the batch.
  Invoiced
  A pay line that has been invoiced
  Can be downloaded for offline AR/GL integrations and synced/re-synced for online

  The Back Office Module allows you to assign products and services to specific companies within your organization. This Company Assignment feature ensures that each Billto organization receives the appropriate invoices and maintains a clear hierarchy for billing purposes.
  The Billto represents the organization that will be invoiced for a product or service. Each Billto organization is uniquely identified by its account name attribute. This ensures that invoices are sent to the correct recipients and helps maintain accurate billing records. The Billto is defined by the field value called
  and can be found as an attribute of each entity within the Billto Hierarchy.
  The Billto Hierarchy is the data model which allows you define how your customers will be invoiced for the products, services and timesheets your company delivers to them. The Back Office module implements an optimistic approach to assignment of Billto Account Names when generating invoices. This is based on the design of the module which uses the lowest assigned node within the Billto hierarchy as the assigned Billto. The table below outlines the Billto Hierarchy at a high level.

  The catalog's taxonomy consists of four levels: Class, Family, Variant, and Pay Plan. This structure enables effective categorization and classification of your products and services. By configuring your offerings within the catalog using this taxonomy, you can easily generate invoices that align with your unique business requirements.
  The
  element defines the invoicing terms for the products and services you sell to your customers. It represents the schedule for invoicing each product or service throughout your business operations based on the Days from Event. Days from Event is the number of calendar days that have elapsed since the fee was realized. For
  or services, this is either the Start Date or the Hire Date. For
  or services, this is the date the product or service was assigned to the customer, either via a scheduled task or one time assignment.
  There are four essential components within the
  configuration:
  This is a required field and is the name of the pay plan.
  Description
  This is a required field and is the description of the pay plan.
  This configuration determines how invoice line items are calculated during the invoice generation process. You can choose between a percentage fee or a flat fee based on the original price of the product or service. The original price is defined as an attribute of the Variant.
  The pay plan line configuration establishes the timeline for processing invoice line items. It ensures that the invoicing process follows a specified schedule based on the agreement you have with your customer. Each pay plan line has a description, payment amount and days from event attribute.
  The pay plan lines must add up to 100% or the the total price of the variant, depending on which payment modifier strategy is selected.
  The
  element within the catalog taxonomy helps you effectively organize and categorize your products and services. It represents the fundamental unit of your product or service that is available for sale. In a retail commercial setting, this would be similar to a SKU. Along with name and description attributes,
  have four essential configuration components:
  This is the amount you intend to charge your customer for the product or service.
  This indicates whether the price is a flat amount or a percentage of another fee, such as the base salary of a placement.
  This represents the cost incurred by your organization to deliver the product to the customer. This value is optional.
  This is the account code for the product or service that corresponds to the item in your G/L system. This code will be included in the invoice line item when sent to the G/L system.
  The
  elements within the catalog taxonomy are groups of product variants. Organizing your variants into families helps you effectively manage your products and services.
  are subcategories of classes and have a name and description. Think of a
  as a folder or group within a class of products or services.
  The
  elements within the catalog taxonomy are the lowest level of organization for your products or services. Classes are groups of families and have a name, description, and For Placement designation. Think of a class as a folder or group that contains categories of products or services.
  The For Placement configuration determines whether invoices generated for families, variants, and pay plans within the class should be created based on placement events. We refer to items within this class as
  . When a placement is created (when a candidate is moved to a Hired status), items assigned with this designation in the catalog can be added to the pending queue and subsequently invoiced. If this check box is not check, any variant within the class would be considered a

CONTENT:
  Our RPO companies have the ability to make company templates of existing child accounts to create future child accounts. Things like submittal workflow and company settings will be copied from the template company so you spend less time setting up new RPO child companies and more time recruiting!
  Step 1: From within the Parent RPO company, go to Settings>RPO Templates. From here, there are a few options:
  In the top right corner is a Create from Existing button. This option allows you to create a new template from an Existing Company.
  In the middle of the screen there will be a list of existing templates if the parent company has already created them, if not it will be blank. To the right of these are
  Manage: which will allow you to edit the template that you selected
  Copy: which will create a duplicate template of the one you selected
  Create Company: which will allow you to create a new company utilizing the template you selected
  Delete: to delete a template if you wish.
  It will look similar to this:
  Step 2: Decide which template you wish to use to create a new company or click the Create from Existing button to make a company template. Then click on the Create Company option next to your choice. This will pop up a screen for you to name the new company as you wish. Click Save.
  Step 3: From within the Parent Company account, Go to Settings>Employees and select which employees you wish to have access to the new company.
  Click on their name.
  In the top of the screen will be a button called Company Management Security. This will allow you to select which companies this employee has access to manage. It will also allow you to select what level of access they will have inside that account, such as Administrator, Recruiter, etc. The user(s) will now see the new companies in their Managed Companies dashboard pane.
  You are all done! If you need licenses for the client to directly access the new child account, please contact
  and we'll be happy to assist you.

  A technical overview of how BrightMove sends email
  Email communication is a critical component of the ATS. Guaranteed delivery of messages is table stakes - our customers expect and demand this. Whether it's sending job offers, interview invitations, or notifications, understanding how the system handles email delivery is critical. At BrightMove, we take this responsibility very seriously, and our goal is to ensure smooth and reliable correspondence.
  To send a an email to an applicant or a hiring manager, you can pick options from the
  dropdown on the left.  From this dropdown, you can select to send a template, blank email or blank SMS (if texting enabled and permitted).
  In addition to the ability to send out impromptu email messages using the
  drop down, BrightMove uses
  to send emails based on specific submittal statuses and the submittal
  . For example, when a candidate applies for a job, a confirmation email indicating receipt of their application can be automatically sent. Email
  are pre-defined and customized email and SMS messages, allowing recruiters and hiring managers to maintain a consistent tone across communication while reducing manual effort.
  Job creation and approval
  Job application submissions
  Submittal workflow status updates
  This is a technical overview of how email delivery works within BrightMove.  When an email is triggered within BrightMove, it follows a well-defined delivery process to ensure successful delivery:
  When an action within the ATS requires email communication, the system generates an email request. This request includes all relevant information such as recipient addresses, email content (using the selected template), and any attachments. All outbound emails are logged in an audit table for analysis and reporting.
  To avoid overloading servers, email requests are queued and sent in order. This helps balance the system load during high-volume periods, such as when multiple job openings receive applications simultaneously. Email queues are monitored and managed for throughput.
  BrightMove integrates with a third-party email service provider called
  to handle the actual email delivery. This service ensures high deliverability rates and allows for tracking of important events and metrics like delivery rates, open rates and bounce rates. There are two types of events tracked within BrightMove:
  events and
  events.
  Additionally, using this external service helps BrightMove to prevent emails from being flagged as spam.
  When using BrightSync, the Office 365 integration, there are settings that allow users to send email through their Office 365 accounts.  This bypasses our third party email service provider.  If "Send With BrightMove" is toggled off, emails will be routed through the user's Office 365 account.  See the
  configuration guide for more info or ask support for help.
  When sending an Offer Letter using an integrated eSignature platform like
  , the email communication with the signers is managed via the signing platform, and is outside the control of BrightMove.  See the
  configuration guide for more info or ask support for help.
  To ensure emails are recognized as legitimate and not filtered out by recipient email servers, BrightMove uses
  and
  authentication protocols. These methods verify that emails are coming from authorized BrightMove servers.
  As of August 2024, BrightMove no longer requires users to setup and maintain SPF records within their DNS services to ensure email deliverability.  Our infrastructure management has made the setup and management of DKIM and SPF obsolete for our customers.
  BrightMove’s email system ensures timely, reliable, and customizable communication through its automated workflows, third-party integration, and robust tracking. It balances speed and security, ensuring messages reach candidates and clients while adhering to best practices like DKIM and SPF.

CONTENT:
  In order to be able to view and change email domains within a company's configuration, the user must have the
  permission assigned to a role they have. Without this permission, the user cannot see the Email Domains link on the Company Settings screen.
  For accounts whose domains are currently configured within BrightMove, we have streamlined the process by automatically verifying the domain through our "soft" verification process. This approach grandfathers in your company's domain and enables the domain to be Ready for Use by your users immediately. Prior to December 31, 2023, BrightMove softly verified all existing domains for sending outbound emails.
  However, this does not mean your domain has been verified from a DNS perspective. In 2024, many domain name service providers, web hosting companies and email service providers are implementing new, stricter email security policies related to domain verification.
  .
  Actions Required by Account Admins
  To ensure a seamless transition, we kindly ask Account Admins (users with the
  permission) to:
  Go to the "Email Domains" screen within "Company Settings" to verify that their email domains are currently configured properly.
  Check if the status of each domain that you send email from and confirm it is "Ready For Use"
  If there is a domain that you wish to send email from that is not listed, add it and follow the instructions to verify the domain.
  If your domain is "Ready For Use" (indicated by a green checkmark) this means the email domain can be used by your company's users register verified emails.
  If your domain is not "Ready For Use" (indicated by a red exclamation point) follow the instructions under the "Actions" column before March 31, 2024, to ensure uninterrupted service.
  If your domain has any red exclamation points shown, follow the instructions under the Actions column.
  Actions Required By Users
  For all users, we request you to validate and update your verified email addresses from your manage profile screen.
  To do this:
  Select "Settings" in the top right corner.
  Navigate to "Profile"
  Update your email address to ensure accurate and authenticated communication.
  Important Consideration for Email Addresses
  For users sending emails from BrightMove using addresses with external domains, we recommend reviewing and updating your email configuration. This ensures that your emails are seamlessly authenticated and delivered.

The time cards listed on the report may be in the "open" or "submitted" categories. If a time card is open, that means the Applicant may still need to edit it. If it is Submitted, that means they have entered all of their hours worked and finalized the time card.

  Brightmove's default criteria to define a Candidate as a duplicate are First Name, Last Name and Email address matching. This means you may get a Sam and a Samuel who are actually the same person. Have no fear, you can merge the two candidate profiles together.
  Brightmove's default criteria to define a Candidate as a duplicate are:
  Duplicates are calculated & refreshed automatically every couple hours by the system however there is a button to Recalculate Duplicates in real-time if needed in the upper right of the Manage Duplicates screen.
  When merging profiles, only certain fields that can hold multiple sources of data will merge, the rest will be taken from the primary candidate profile. The fields that DO merge are: candidate notes, candidate resumes, education, candidate references, submittals, candidate attachments, timecards, and submittal activities.
  When merging two profiles, for single field captures, like Source or Address, where you can only have one answer, the source in the chosen primary profile remains. The source listed in the merged profile is not copied over.
  To get to the duplicate candidate management section:
  Click your picture in upper right (Quick Links menu).

  Click

  Once you open the Duplicate Candidates you will see the duplicate profiles displayed. The
  column lets you know how many people match the criteria you selected in the Duplication Fields section in the Settings menu.

  You can view the duplicate profiles to determine which one should remain after the merge if you'd like. If you already know which profile should remain, skip to step 3.
  Choose the profile you wish to remain the primary profile.
  Click Save. The duplicates will now be gone and the single selected profile will remain.
  *Once merged, the duplicate profiles no longer exist and cannot be recovered or split back out.

CONTENT:
  A business would want to use a taxonomy within the
  for several reasons:
  Organizational Structure: A taxonomy provides a structured and hierarchical organization of products and services. It allows businesses to categorize and classify their offerings systematically. This structure helps in locating and managing products efficiently, especially when dealing with a large inventory.
  Streamlined Navigation: With a taxonomy in place, users can easily navigate and search for specific products or services within the catalog. The hierarchical structure allows for logical grouping and sub-grouping, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
  Consistent Classification: By using a taxonomy, businesses can establish consistent classification standards for their products and services. This ensures that items are classified uniformly across the organization, reducing confusion and facilitating effective communication.
  Automation and Efficiency: A taxonomy enables automation and streamlines various processes, such as generating invoices. By structuring products and services in a standardized taxonomy, businesses can automate the invoicing process based on predefined rules. This automation saves time and reduces the chances of errors.
  Scalability and Flexibility: As a business grows and introduces new products or services, a taxonomy allows for easy scalability. New items can be added to the existing taxonomy structure, maintaining consistency and ensuring that the catalog remains organized and manageable.
  Data Analysis and Reporting: A well-defined taxonomy provides a solid foundation for data analysis and reporting. By categorizing products and services consistently, businesses can gather meaningful insights, identify trends, and generate accurate reports for decision-making.
  Integration with Systems: Taxonomies are often used as a common language across various systems and departments within an organization. A standardized taxonomy in the product catalog facilitates seamless integration with other systems, such as accounting or inventory management, ensuring smooth data flow and reducing data inconsistencies.
  Overall, using a taxonomy within a product catalog brings structure, efficiency, and standardization to the management of products and services. It simplifies navigation, enables automation, supports scalability, and enhances data analysis capabilities, leading to improved operational efficiency and better customer experiences.

  <h1 id="h_610162f579">Fee Realization from Products and Services</h1>
CONTENT:
  Fee realization is when your company delivers a service that will result in a fee that can be invoiced to one of your customers. Fees are realized through two different types of events.
  A
  is submitted and approved against a contract placement
  An event associated with an assigned product or service defined within the Catalog occurs
  Fee realization happens during the course of business operations as data is captured and recorded by your team. The Back Office module will automatically aggregate all realized fees during the
  and generate a batch of invoices to be delivered to your AR/GL system.
  For more information on
  .
  Fee realization for products and services occurs when two conditions are met: An event occurs that has an associated fee and a
  rule has been defined for the associated Billto entity.
  a. Placement Products & Services
  When using the Back Office module, once your team records a placement within BrightMove, a fee is realized. These are commonly referred to as hiring fees or recruiting fees. They can be flat fees or calculated from percentages of the placement salary. When the placement is saved, the Back Office module evaluates the placement salary attributes and the assigned product pay plan and calculates the appropriate fees to be invoiced. These realized fees are converted into invoices and subsequently loaded to your AR/GL system through the supported BrightMove integrations. The event date for placement products, the effective date of the fee and it's invoice, is the start date of the placement.
  Placement fees are realized by selecting the appropriate pay plan on the
  screen.
  In this scenario, the placement has been saved with base salary of
  and the
  pay plan. For this example, considering the following additional values:
  There is a product variant which defines the fee saved in the catalog
  The variant is in a family called
  The variant is called
  The variant has a price set as 25% percentage fee
  The pay plan has two lines with payment modifier strategy set as percentage
  The first pay plan line is set for 0 days from event
  The second pay plan line is set for 90 days from event
  This pay plan results in a $25,000 fee realization.
  This pay plan realizes fees to be invoiced in two equal payments, each for 50% of the total fee, on two specific dates.
  0 day after the start date of the new employee, or July 10, 2023 in this example.
  90 days after the start date of the new employee, or October 8, 2023 in this example.
  b. Non-Placement Products & Services
  When using the Back Office module, your team can record other fees which are not associated with placements as well. These are called Non-placement products. Typical non-placement fees are program management fees, ad hoc fees and other charges. Non-product fees can be generated in a one-time fashion or through a schedule. Like placement fees, these realized fees are converted into invoices and subsequently loaded to your AR/GL system through the support BrightMove integrations. The event date for non-placement products, the effective date of the fee and it's invoice, is the data the fee was created.

  The Planner is located in your Quick Links menu and can also be displayed on the Dashboard if you choose (Dashboard Pane). It gives the user a list of each activity that is scheduled or has already been performed during the current day. The activities come from Client Contact Profiles and Applicant Profiles. There is a calendar displayed just above the current day's activities that allows the user to choose a different day to view.
  To add an activity from the Planner screen, click on the "Add Activity" link in the upper right corner or click on the time-space to open the new activity window. Fill in the activity details, and click the "Submit" button.
  Submittal activity data will also be tracked on the planner and will show as yellow tiles. These activities can be edited from the planner the same way as your standard activities.
  You may also go to the Applicant or Contact profile and enter an activity there, and it will be reflected on the Planner. If the activity requires an Action, that is a "Task". You determine what Activity actions are Tasks, examples are Call, Email, Interview, etc. Tasks can be viewed in the Quick Links menu or from the My Tasks dashboard pane.
  Choose an activity type from the drop-down box on the screen (This list can be customized in Settings under Customization>Activity Type).
  The Start Time and End Time automatically default to the present date and time with a 30-minute duration. They can be changed to whatever time and duration you like, or you can set it as an all-day event and simply enter the dates. If you check Exclude Weekends and select start date and end date that have weekend days in between, the activity will not show up on the weekend on the planner.
  If you would like to set a reminder for yourself about this activity or to follow up on it, check the "set reminder" box and select the time frame you would like to be reminded. A reminder will be created in the reminders list that displays in the upper right next to your profile icon and name.
  If you click "Set Follow Up", you can quickly create another activity at the same time as creating the current activity. When clicked the new activity is defaulted with a 15-minute reminder, and the times are set to one day after the activity times above. When you click save, two separate activities will be created.
  You can set up different reoccurring patterns for an activity whether it's daily, monthly, weekly, etc. Just build your pattern using the radio buttons and then select an end date for the pattern to end. Reoccurrence patterns do not apply to a Follow Up Activity.
  Resources will share this activity with other recruiters or workgroups. You can choose to send them or your self an email notification after you save the activity. Resources do not apply to a Follow Up Activity.
  Click on the activity that needs to be edited and the Activity detail screen will be displayed. Click the blue "Edit" link in the footer, and then make the appropriate changes. Once the editing is complete, click the Submit button to save the edited activity. Alternatively, you may also drag and drop any planner activity to a new date and/or time to initiate the editing process. If you need to move a scheduled appointment for the day, you may simply drag the activity and place it into the correct time slot.
  Tasks have been separated into individual sections for those that are Active, Due Today, Due this Week, Overdue, and Completed. Marking tasks as completed or reverting them back to an incomplete status is now easy to accomplish and can be done in bulk. BrightMove task management has never been better!
  The Active tab will contain all tasks with a due date and time of today at 11:59 pm or all past tasks that have not been marked as Completed.
  Due Today will contain all tasks due that day.
  Due This Week will contain all tasks due on the basis of Monday - Sunday.
  Overdue will contain all past tasks that have not been marked as Completed.
  Completed will contain all tasks that have been marked as such and will display a strike-through line across each recorded task.
  Select the
  action button to filter your tasks by a set range of time.
  To process any tasks in bulk, simply select the bubble to the left of the Due Date column. Selecting multiple tasks will display an events listing, and selecting all tasks within the view will provide an option to select every task, even if that task list is not in your current view. Once selected, you can mass update the tasks to either Complete or Incomplete as needed.
  Besides the regular activities/tasks, they are special activities each slight unique to Applicants, Contacts, Requirements, and Opportunities. They all function very similar to activities above accept instead of being tasks for yourself they are now attached to their respective types as well.
  If an email is sent from within BrightMove (mass or single email), it is automatically recorded in the Activities section of the appropriate profile.
  In submittal activities are also automatically recorded in the Applicant's activities.
  You can add applicant activities via the following methods:
  The applicant profile via the "Add Activity" button in the top right.

With customizable document templates and powerful data substitution fields, you can automate offer details while maintaining a consistent, polished candidate experience.

  Upload the document to your BrightMove Document Repository. (
  The following fields are supported for automated substitution when setting up your Offer Letter Template.
  The syntax of substitution fields for Offer Letter Templates is unique and differs from the syntax used in Communication Templates (emails, etc.). If you wish to send an email with dynamic placeholders, see the

  <h2 id="h_8212131278">Why These Options Matter</h2>
CONTENT:
  Differences between Send to Draft (edit/review) and Send Offer Letter (send/sign) in BrightMove’s DocuSign integration for offer letters.
  When using BrightMove’s integration with DocuSign to send offer letters, you’ll encounter two key options:
  and
  . While both are part of the offer letter process, they serve distinct purposes to help you manage candidate offers efficiently. This article explains the differences to help you choose the right option for your needs.
  The
  option allows you to prepare an offer letter and save it as a draft within DocuSign without immediately sending it to the candidate or other recipients. Think of it as a "save for later" feature that gives you flexibility to review and refine before finalizing.
  : You can generate the offer letter in BrightMove, send it to DocuSign as a draft, and then review or edit it in DocuSign’s editor. This is ideal for ensuring all details, such as salary, job title, or placeholders for signatures, are correct.
  : Drafts allow internal stakeholders (e.g., hiring managers or HR) to review the document in DocuSign before it’s sent to the candidate. You can add or adjust signature fields, placeholders, or other content as needed.
  : The candidate doesn’t receive anything yet, giving you time to perfect the offer letter.
  : Choose Send to Draft when you want to double-check the offer letter, gather internal approvals, or make last-minute changes in DocuSign before sending it out.
  :
  In BrightMove, create an offer letter for a candidate in the Offer stage.
  Select
  instead of sending directly.
  The letter is uploaded to DocuSign as a draft envelope, where you can open it, make edits, or add signature fields.
  Once ready, you can manually send the draft from BrightMove by going to Settings > eSignature Queue to finalize the process.
  The
  option is the action that sends the finalized offer letter directly to the candidate and any other designated recipients (e.g., internal signers) through DocuSign for e-signatures. This is the step that initiates the formal offer process with the candidate.
  : The offer letter is sent to the candidate’s email with a link to review and sign in DocuSign, streamlining the acceptance process.
  : The letter is prepped with signature placeholders (e.g., for the candidate or internal stakeholders), and DocuSign tracks the signing progress in real time.
  : BrightMove syncs with DocuSign to reflect the offer’s status (e.g., sent, viewed, signed, or declined) on the candidate’s profile.
  : Choose Send Offer Letter when the offer is finalized, approved, and ready for the candidate to review and sign.
  :
  In BrightMove, prepare the offer letter with all necessary details and placeholders.
  Select
  to push the document to DocuSign.
  DocuSign emails the candidate and any internal signers (if applicable) with a secure link to sign the letter.
  Once signed, the completed document is available in BrightMove, and the candidate’s offer status is updated.
  Feature
  Send to Draft
  Send Offer Letter
  Save and edit the letter before sending
  Send the finalized letter for signing
  No one is notified yet
  Candidate and signers receive the letter
  Editable in DocuSign as a draft
  Sent as-is, minimal edits possible
  Used for preparation and review
  Used when ready to engage the candidate
  Remains in draft/pending status
  Updates to sent/signed/declined status
  : If you’re unsure about placeholders (e.g., {{candidate_signature}} or {{date}}), use Send to Draft to verify they’re correctly placed in DocuSign. Make the placeholder text color match the document background for a clean look.
  : Ensure all internal approvals are complete before selecting Send Offer Letter, as changes after sending can complicate the process.
  : You’ll need permission to generate and send offer letters in BrightMove. Contact your admin if you run into access issues.
  : After sending, track the offer’s progress in BrightMove’s candidate profile to stay updated on signatures or declinations.
  The
  and
  features give you control over the offer process. Drafts provide a safety net for polishing the letter and collaborating internally, while Send Offer Letter ensures a seamless, professional experience for candidates with secure e-signatures. By understanding when to use each, you can streamline your hiring workflow and present polished offers every time.
  If you have questions about BrightMove’s DocuSign integration or need help setting it up, reach out to our support team or your BrightMove point of contact. Happy hiring!

  (Timecard Default start day is Sunday-Saturday=1, additional start days should be set up as Monday-Sunday=2, Tuesday-Monday=3, Wednesday-Tuesday=4, Thursday-Wednesday=5, Friday-Saturday=6 ,Saturday-Sunday=7). If week differs from the default, please let us know as this will need to be set up prior to using time cards. (ex. Monday thru Sunday)

  The Time and Billing module is found in the Reports module. There are 3 reports available to manage Timecards:
  ,
  , and
  The Billable Hours Report will give the user a snapshot of all of the billable hours within a specified time frame.
  The Time Sheet report is broken down by week, and gives you a summary of each Accepted Applicant's billable and non-billable hours for that week. If a time sheet is showing as open, that means the Applicant may still need to edit it and hasn't submitted it yet. If it is Submitted, that means they have entered all of their hours worked and finalized the time sheet. Click on a name to view the timecard for that employee.
  You will see a Summary at the top that includes Period, Billable Hours, Non-Billable hours, Total Hours, Total Expenses (If in use), and Status.
  You can also see who approved the timecard and the date/time it was approved!
  Sometimes the Hiring Manager does not approve the timecards and the BrightMove users approve on their behalf. In this case, you will see Approve and Return buttons at the bottom of the screen for you to Approve or Return timecards.
  In the event you need to unapprove a timecard that has already been approved, there is a security role permission to allow a user to do so by role. To enable this, go to Settings> Security> Timecards module.
  When enabled, after a timecard is marked as Approved, there will be an Unapprove button in the bottom of the timesheet.
  Gives the user a quick way to view which Candidates have not submitted their time cards for the week. You have the option of viewing the Candidates unsubmitted timecard by clicking the link for the candidates name or you can email one or more candidates by selecting the check box next to the Candidate(s) you wish to email and select either Blank Email or an email template requesting they submit their timecard. See below for an example of the report.
  .
  Hiring Managers/Contact can log in at
  and enter their assigned username/password.
  At the top of the screen there is an "Approve Timesheets" option.
  All timesheets submitted to the hiring manager waiting for approval will be shown there and can be filtered using the Timecard Start Date dropdown (top). Click on a name to view the timecard.
  They will see a Summary at the top that includes Period, Billable Hours, Non-Billable hours, Total Hours, Total Expenses (If in use), and Status.
  The Approve and Return buttons are at the bottom of the form. There is also an optional Comments box available for the Hiring Manager to make notes to the Employee or for the Employee to write comments to the Hiring Manager.
  There is a comments history area underneath to show a record of the correspondence both ways.
  BrightMove Back Office is a billing and timecard platform that allows staffing professionals to streamline their daily operations by providing one easy-to-use interface for all their staffing needs. This fully integrated back office functionality is accessible directly from BrightMove Staffing and is compatible with Quick Books.
  Benefits of BrightMove Back Office include a completely responsive interface (changes made in the system are reflected in real-time) and easy configuration (set and manage payment terms, add and manage accounts and configure contract and other preferences).
  BrightMove Back Office allows users to generate invoices & see a snapshot view of approved & non-approved time sheets, billable & non-billable hours, clients to invoice and total to invoice.
  The system also has a “Health Check” that users must run before creating invoices to ensure that data has been imported correctly and all preferences have been properly set.
  If the applicant doesn't have a timesheet for a specific job or a timecard for a week, check the following:
  That they are on a placement submittal status. (Hired, Start, Accepted)
  That they have a placement record
  Correct Dates are showing on the placement record.
  That the job was labeled as a Contract Placement.
  Go to Settings> Security. Choose the Client Contact security role and check that access is allowed next to each time module.
  You can also restrict available timecard actions here as well by clicking the check box next to an item and an X will appear instead.

  Here we cover the process for turning your great idea into a reality through our Feature Request system called Feedback.
  With Feedback, you can participate in the BrightMove development process with an easy, efficient tool that gives your feature requests a platform for community involvement. Request, vote for, and share your great ideas today!
  All product requests are reviewed by our Product Owner to determine if they are good for the community of BrightMove users. Most new requests are set to the "Awaiting Feedback" status so that more people can vote, prioritize, and give us information. This allows us to gauge demand, gather use cases, and automatically establish impact and value.
  Every week our Product Teams hold a product feedback meeting. They discuss the highest priorities for our customers, team members and prospects, and look at how the requests align with our own strategy.
  As the team goes through, they will update the status of each request in Receptive so that you immediately know the outcome.
  If we decide to build a feature or make an improvement, the status will change to "Planned" or "Building". Once a feature is ready, we will announce its availability in our release notes and on our message of the day section of the login screen.
  Anyone who has submitted or voted on a specific request will be notified when the status to the request is updated. We will always provide an explanation as to the nature of the status update.
  Items will be reviewed by the product owner on a weekly basis; we take the top requests and update the status where appropriate. We decide quarterly what items our development team will focus on and they get released as part of our normal release cycle.

  Setting your priorities is also a good way to help make sure the features that are most important to you make their way into BrightMove. Here's how your priorities in Feedback work.
  Once you begin casting your votes for feature requests or submitting new requests they will appear in the section on your dashboard called
  . The higher the priority for a request, the more weight it is given, causing it to be moved higher on the list of requested features.
  You will be able to adjust the importance of these items by using the slider for each request. There is a set ratio for the importance scale, so as you increase the importance of one feature, the slider for your other feature requests will decrease. You will also always have the option to remove a feature request from your list by selecting the

  The BrightFlow view offers a kanban board style screen for working with your candidate's submittal workflow. Each column is called a "Swimlane", and your company settings will determine how many Swimlanes are available to work within. Select the BrightFlow action button to switch to this dynamic view.
  To update a candidate's submittal status, you will need to either Add Activity to continue working within your current swimlane or drag-and-drop the candidate's card into the next applicable swimlane. Either action will trigger the submittal status update window to appear.

CONTENT:
  In this article, you will learn how Power Search Expert Mode enables you to search multiple fields within BrightMove at once using
  . This format allows you to optimize your input to the Power Search engine, and to use advanced combinations or operators to retrieve information from the BrightMove database. If you are familiar with using Boolean searches, this is the search mode for you.
  Expert Mode is available within Power Search of any entity (Applicant, Job, Hiring Manager, Client, Department). In this article, we'll use Candidate Power Searches to demonstrate Expert Mode. To access the Expert Mode mode:
  Expand the Candidate menu item on the left
  Select Power Search under the Search menu group
  On the Power Search screen, check the check mark for
  .
  Once the checkbox labeled
  is checked, the screen is updated with a textbox, ready for input using the
  . See the table below which lists the fields available for
  To use Expert Mode, you'll need to construct your query using
  . This format is described below. In summary, the format allows you to specify which specific fields you wish to search based on specific search terms.
  this is an attribute of an entity, like a name, title, resume, etc. Use the search field variable name to specify which field to search.
  this is the value you wish to search for. Search terms can be made up of multiple words, or tokens. A search term like
  is a single search term, with two tokens (
  and
  ).
  these are instructions to Power Search to perform logical grouping or filtering on the search results. These are the rules for combining the results.
  To use Expert Mode, you must put the search input into
  .
  search_field:search_term
  The simple example, in Expert Query Format, will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with one token)
  . Note, this is a single token search term.
  text:specialist
  The example, in Expert Query Format, will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with two tokens)
  . Note, this is a single term with two tokens. This example uses the quotation marks as an
  . Surrounding the search term's two tokens within quotation marks instructs Power Search to require the terms to be sequentially present in one of the fields in the entity.
  text:"compliance specialist"
  This is also sometimes referred to as an OR search. This example will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with two tokens)
  OR
  . Note, this is a single term with two tokens, but it has not been surrounded within quotation marks. This instructs Power Search to look for either token in one of the fields in the entity.
  text:compliance specialist
  The example, in Expert Query Format, will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with two tokens)
  . Note, this is a single term with two tokens. This example uses the quotation marks as an
  . Surrounding the two search term tokens within quotation marks instructs Power Search to require the terms to be present in sequential order within the current_title field in the entity.
  current_title:"compliance specialist"
  This is another example of an OR search. This example will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with two tokens)
  OR
  . Note, this is a single term with two tokens, but it has not been surrounded within quotation marks. This instructs Power Search to look for either token in current_title field in the entity.
  current_title:compliance specialist
  The example, in Expert Query Format, will search
  (the search field) in the Candidate entity for (the search term with one token)
  AND the
  (another search field) for candidates with scores of 3,4 or 5. Notice that the rank terms are contained within parentheses and separated with the Boolean operator OR. This will instruct the Power Search engine to require both
  and at least one of the rank values specified.
  text:specialist AND (rank:3 OR rank:4 OR rank:5)
  The asterisk (*) symbol is a very powerful character when it comes to Power Search. Adding the asterisk to a search term instructs the Power Search engine to expand its search for what to look for. As an example, you can tell Power Search to search based on fragments of words, or plural versions. This example will find results that have the fragment
  within the current title field. In this case, matches would be found for "special", "specials" or "specialist".

  We have expanded on our job approver functionality by adding the ability for hiring managers, recruiters, and HR department staff to create delegates for job approval chains.
  Possible use cases:
  A hiring manager is out on PTO and assigns another HM to approve jobs on their behalf between a certain date range while they are out.
  Peers can grant perpetual delegate authority to each other to create an "Approval Group" to ensure jobs are routed through the process with efficiency and quality.
  The delegation of approval authority is easily removed and transparent to all users in the approval chain.
  New fields show who the current approver is, who the next approver in line is, and who has been delegated to approve jobs on that manager's behalf. Once everyone in the chain has approved the job, then it is open for recruiting.

  GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation
  Data Controller: This is you, the in-house recruiter/employer. You control the purposes for which the Candidate data is processed. It is your responsibility to ensure that the ATS you work with can be configured to be GDPR compliant and to ensure your account is configured in a way that is GDPR compliant. BrightMove is supplying our customers with a checklist (below) to allow you to confirm your account settings are GDPR complaint.
  Data Processor: This is the ATS provider, in this case BrightMove, since we process Candidate data on your behalf.
  Our technology is flexible enough for our customers to make adjustments to existing accounts so they can be GDPR compliant. Accounts are not necessarily GDPR compliant "out-of-the-box". You should review the compliance rules and features inside your account to ensure the proper settings are enabled. The GDPR not only applies to organisations located within the EU but it will also apply to organisations located outside of the EU if they offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of EU data subjects. It applies to all companies processing and holding the personal data of data subjects residing in the European Union, regardless of the company’s location.
  Below is an ATS checklist of how to achieve account settings that enable you to be GDPR compliant from an ATS perspective. GDPR went into effect on May 28th 2018.
  Process candidate data only according to documented instructions from the controller(s).
  Implement necessary measures to safeguard the candidate data, including:
  The encryption or pseudonymization of candidate data.
  The ability to maintain a high-quality processing system and service.
  Regular testing and evaluating the measures to ensure the security of the processing.
  Delete or return all candidate data to the controller(s) on request.
  Demonstrate the ATS’ compliance with the GDPR to the controller(s). We cannot guarantee compliance as a user can affect settings in such a way that could make the account non-compliant but we do give you the tools you need to make the account compliant. See The GDPR Checklist for Customers below on some areas you should pay attention to and possibly set up.
  We have compiled some items we know you will need to manage within your account in order to be GDPR compliant. This checklist is not necessarily a complete list and is not legal advice so please consult your Legal resources to ensure your compliance.

  Yes! The OFCCP module allows client who are affected by these regulations to stay in full compliance. When you sign up for BrightMove, tell your representative that you are an OFCCP Compliant company and they will make sure to turn the module on for you. There is no additional cost.
  *We have modified the OFCCP disability and Veteran questions in compliance with the OFCCP changes effective March 24, 2014. We replaced the Yes/No Disability question with Form CC305 choices, added the "pre-offer" Veteran classification questions and created the ability to turn these questions on or off independent of each other based on the OFCCP contract requirements.
  When your account is OFCCP enabled you cannot mass submit Candidates to jobs in the Choose Action for list dropdowns throughout the software. You can submit a single Candidate to a job from the Candidate profile.
  Go to Settings> Company Preferences. In the "Portal" section are the following options:
  Show EEOC for Online Application - Shows Race & Gender questions
  Show EEOC - Vet Status (Show EEOC Must be Active)- Shows the "pre-offer" Veteran question to the Candidates on the portal.
  Show EEOC - Disability Status (Show EEOC Must be Active)- Shows the Disability question to the Candidates on the portal.
  Describe Disability and Veteran Criteria - If true, will display the "More info" options (OFCCP VEVRAA and 503 form content) on Veteran status and Disability portal questions.
  *Please Note: When OFCCP is enabled at the company level, Candidate profile Gravatar pictures will not be displayed.
  If the EEOC fields are hidden (false) in your Company Preferences, the EEOC override boxes will be shown on the Client profiles. This allows you to have the EEOC questions off for all Clients and the ability turn them on only for Clients that require them to be asked according to OFCCP laws.
  Simply edit the Client profile to check or un-check these selections.
  Override Portal EEOC- Shows Race & Gender questions on the portal
  Override Veteran Status- Shows the "pre-offer" Veteran question to the Candidates on the portal.
  Override Disability Status- Shows the Disability question to the Candidates on the portal.
  ​
  You have to tell your BrightMove representative that you need to be in compliance with OFCCP Regulations. There is no way for BrightMove to know that you need access to the OFCCP module unless you tell your representative.

  A candidate emailed you their resume. Did you know you can create a profile for that candidate in your BrightMove without leaving your email? Here's how.
  The email parser is the tool within BrightMove that will create an applicant profile automatically when you forward a resume from your email inbox. The resume can be attached to an email or in the body of an email. To use this feature,
  1. Determine what your company's email parser address is.
  a. Click on your name.
  b. Click on
  .
  c. Click on
  .
  d. Your parser address will be next to
  and end in @parser.brightmove.ai
  2. Locate the email you want to parse.
  3. Click Forward.
  4. Delete your signature and any information other than the resume.
  5. Type in your company's email parser address.
  6. Click send.
  a. If the First name, Last name, AND Email or Work email info
  an existing profile, a new Applicant profile will be created for you.
  b. If the First name, Last name, AND Email or Work Email info
  an existing profile, you will see a message on the existing profile letting you know there is a new resume to parse.
  You will receive an email notification of a completed parse. This cannot be disabled.
  Employees can only have one email address on their profile or the parser will not work.
  There is a user permission that needs to be enabled to use the email parser. See your admin if you feel you need this permission.
  Vendors can also use your email parser.
  You can also parse resumes
  with this method. If there are multiple attachments, the parser will grade the resumes and use the one with the highest score to create a profile.

  <h1 class="mb-1 font-primary text-2xl font-bold leading-10 text-body-primary-color">Understanding User Defined Fields (UDFs)</h1>
  <h1 id="UnderstandingUserDefinedFields(UDFs)-InthisArticle">In this Article</h1>
  <h2 id="h_eae20fff5e">Structure</h2>
  <h2 id="h_26814aad6b">Examples:</h2>
  Ex 1: Candidate Certifications
  Ex 2: Manager Information
CONTENT:
  A User Defined Field is a section of the BrightMove Application that the individual user creates and customizes. It is visible to other users at your workplace. When you create a User Defined Field, you are actually adding a section to one of the Profile pages. You may add to the Candidate, Client/Department, Manager, Department/Location, or Job profile as well as Placement and Reference Check details.
  UDF's are helpful when you need to keep track of specific information that your company is interested in. For example, it may be helpful to know if nurses have a certain certification. A field could be created asking if the Candidate has that certification and the information would be captured in the Candidate Profile. Another example may be when Account representatives want to keep track of anniversary dates and the names of favorite sports teams associated with their Clients.
  A
  is the highest level for a UDF. There can be multiple questions in a section. This name is seen in BrightMove as the name of the tab on the specific profile. A section can be assigned to multiple different entities. Any questions in the section will then be assigned to each of those entities.
  A
  is the middle level for a UDF. These are the questions or statements that will appear on the entity profiles.
  An
  is the lowest level for a UDF. This will only appear when you have the field type Select Drop Down. This is where you create options for your drop-down.
  Let's use the two examples we provided: It may be helpful to know if nurses have a certain certification and keep track of anniversary dates and the names of favorite sports teams associated with Managers.
  Section: Certification
  Field: What type of certification do you have?, Select Drop Down
  Option: ENP, FNP, CPN, etc.
  On the Candidate Profile:
  Section: Fun Facts
  Field: Favorite Football Team, Text
  Option: none
  On the Manager Profile:
  Each User Defined Field (UDF) has a
  that acts as its unique identifier. This key is automatically generated based on the field key and entity type (e.g., applicant, manager, job).
  You can view the field key on the
  page under the
  column. If the field is enabled for multiple entities, you’ll see a separate key for each one.
  If your UDF field key is called “Favorite Football Team” and it's enabled for Applicant, Job, and Placement, you’ll see:
  udf.applicant.favorite_football_team
  udf.job.favorite_football_team
  udf.placement.favorite_football_team
  Field keys are used to reference UDF values in places where you want data to be automatically inserted — such as
  .
  To use a field key in a document:
  Wrap the key in ${} to enable automated substitution
  Example: ${udf.applicant.favorite_football_team}
  This tells the system to replace the placeholder with the actual data stored in the UDF for the selected applicant, job, or placement when generating the document.
  Only UDFs for Applicant, Job, and Placement entities are supported in offer letters.

  Interview Fields in Email and Text Communication Templates
  User Defined Fields in Email and Text Communication Templates
  Important Note:
CONTENT:
  Create reusable email and text messages that you send commonly
  Communication templates are pre-written email and text messages tailored to specific user types in your hiring process. They help you standardize important communications with candidates, hiring managers, and other stakeholders. For example, you can create an "Application Declined" template with your company's standard messaging for job seekers not selected for a role. Other common templates include application acknowledgments ("We received your application"), process updates ("Next steps in the hiring process"), and welcome messages. Whenever you need to send consistent, professional messages that you use frequently throughout your recruitment process, communication templates are the ideal solution.

  This is the internal name for your template. It will not be seen by the email recipient.
  This is the subject of your email.
  This is the body of your email. Type your message here.
  Here you can add any attachments from your Document Repository.
  Check this box if you do not want any other users to see your template.
  Use this box to select what type of template it is (Email, SMS, Email & SMS, or Trigger)
  This is the recipient of your email (Candidate, Manager, Recruiter, Interviewer, Sourcer, Sales, or Vendor).
  The available fields will change depending on who your template is used for. To add these to your template, simply click the field you wish to add from the list to the right. This will automatically add the correct field input to your template.
  Communication Template Substitution Fields are special placeholders that automatically insert personalized information when your template as an email or SMS text message is sent.  You can use these fields to dynamically embed values from the ATS into messages sent out.  For example, if you wish to embed the name of the recipient within the template, you can use substitution fields for this.
  Field Format:
  Available fields appear in the list to the right of your template editor
  Click any field to automatically insert it into your template
  When your communication is sent, the system replaces these fields with recipient-specific information
  Example: <C>FirstName<C> becomes "John" when sent to a candidate named John
  The fields you can use depend on who your template is for (candidates, managers, etc.) and are displayed on the Communication Template screen
  Each recipient type offers different relevant field options

  You've learned how to create a Job Approver. But what if you have multiple users who need to approve a job before it's ready to go live?

  From here, you can rearrange the approver order by clicking and dragging the

  The order of your approvers in an approval chain is very important. This determines the
  of who approves the job, starting from the
  at the top and ending at the
  at the bottom.
  In the example below, Sam will approve the job
  then it passes to Rodion
  . Finally, Jason gives the final approval and the job is created.
  The order that you have established here
  be followed. Every member of your approval chain must approve the job in the appropriate order until the chain is complete and the job is approved.
  If the job creator is a
  who is inside of this approval chain, the job will not be approved until it makes its way through the approval process, unless they are the
  in the chain. If they are the final approver, the system will behave as if all preceding approvers have approved the job.
  Alternatively, if the recruiter is neither first nor last, only a portion of the chain needs to be completed.
  : Using the same screenshot above as a reference, if Rodion were to create a job, the system will behave as if Sam has already approved it, while Jason will still need to provide the final approval.

  In our following examples, we are going to be performing a
  Power Search, but this will work for the same for Client/Department, Manager, and Job Power Searches.
  ​
  By Default, your filter dropdown displays

  To begin adding filters to your power search:
  Click on
  to open the filter dropdown menu
  Select which type of filter to apply (
  in our example)
  ​
  Enter your keyword or phrase into the
  box, then click
  Depending on which filter you select, the
  box may turn into a dropdown menu or number selector. Most commonly, it is a text box where you can type words or phrases.
  ​
  Here's an example where we've selected a
  filter, typed the term

  As you can see, the results have been narrowed down to 15 candidates, all of which have

  Notice that the

  boxes and the boxes themselves have been cleared out.
  Let's add another filter.
  Follow the exact same process above after you click
  on the previous search term.
  Once you add your second filter, the results should look like this:
  By adding both filters in this way, this has automatically created an
  search, meaning that the results will only display candidates with both

  To join filters:
  Click the small blue

  Select
  From this dropdown menu, you can also:
  ​
  the individual filter
  the individual filter
  This will combine both filters into an
  search, where the results will display candidates that fulfill at least
  of the criteria, but not necessarily both.
  Once joined, the filter dropdown menu changes:
  From here, you can:

  entirely from your results.
  To do this, following these steps:
  Click on

  Select which type of filter to apply
  ​
  Enter your keyword or phrase into the
