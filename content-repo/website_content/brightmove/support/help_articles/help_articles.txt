• For more technical details: Scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given document is to a user's query. The idea behind the VSM is that the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of Boolean logic in the query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements to this model to support Boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM-based system at the heart.

• The BrightMove security & engineering team is always monitoring the platform for stability & security. In February 2022, BrightMove rapidly deployed a security patch to protect against a zero-day vulnerability that our team became aware of through the security channels we monitor. This vulnerability was in 3rd party code BrightMove leverages, not code authored by BrightMove directly. A patch deployment was done to protect our clients & infrastructure against this published exploit. During this patch, there was some technical debt that we accumulated, in the form of redundant files and manual processes. Our engineering team worked with the author of the 3rd party code to reintegrate the secured code into our automated development pipeline.

They can be flat fees or calculated from percentages of the placement salary. When the placement is saved, the Back Office module evaluates the placement salary attributes and the assigned product pay plan and calculates the appropriate fees to be invoiced. These realized fees are converted into invoices and subsequently loaded to your AR/GL system through the supported BrightMove integrations. The event date for placement products, the effective date of the fee and it's invoice, is the start date of the placement.

• Here are some more technical details if you were curious: Scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model (VSM) of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a User's query. The idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query. It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the Query specification. Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements to this model to support boolean and fuzzy searching, but it essentially remains a VSM based system at the heart.
