# SaaS Pricing Best Practices (BrightMove Edition)

## 1. Value-Based Pricing
- Price based on customer value, not just cost-plus
- Regularly review pricing vs. market and customer ROI

## 2. Tiered Plans
- Offer clear tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Gate features and support by tier

## 3. Usage-Based Add-Ons
- For variable cost services (AI, SMS, job posts), use prepaid bundles + overage
- Make overage rates and batch expiration clear

## 4. Annual vs. Monthly
- Offer 10-15% discount for annual prepay
- Encourage annual for enterprise, monthly for SMB

## 5. Transparent Billing
- Itemize all SKUs, usage, and overages
- Automate billing, dunning, and collections

## 6. Minimum Commitments
- Set minimums for enterprise to ensure revenue floor

## 7. Margin Tracking
- Track COGS and margin per SKU, especially for arbitrage

## 8. Self-Service
- Let customers buy more units or upgrade online
- Automate usage alerts and top-ups

## 9. Invoice Clarity
- Make invoices easy to understand and audit

## 10. Implementation Fees
- Charge for onboarding, data migration, and new product go-live to cover costs and ensure customer commitment.
- Make fees transparent and standardized where possible.

## 11. Partner/White Label Pricing
- Offer discounted rates for partners with minimum commitments or volume tiers.
- Require partners to handle their own billing and support.
- Track partner margin and performance separately from retail.
