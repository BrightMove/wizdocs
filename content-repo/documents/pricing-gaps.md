# Pricing Gaps & Recommendations

## Gaps in Current Methods
- No published usage-based pricing for AI, SMS, or job sponsorships
- No clear SKU structure for usage-based products
- Professional services not productized or bundled
- No self-service for add-on/usage purchases
- Overage and batch expiration policies not defined
- Margin analysis for arbitrage not automated
- No clear annual vs. monthly discount policy
- Limited upsell/cross-sell automation
- Implementation fees are not always standardized or clearly communicated for new product go-live or add-ons.
- Partner/white label pricing structure is not fully documented or automated.

## Recommendations
- Publish usage-based pricing and SKU catalog
- Productize professional services (bundles, packages)
- Enable self-service add-on/usage purchases
- Define and communicate overage/expiration policies
- Automate margin tracking for arbitrage products
- Offer clear annual prepay discounts
- Build upsell/cross-sell into onboarding and billing flows
- Standardize and publish implementation fee schedules for new customers and product add-ons.
- Document and automate partner/white label pricing, including margin and volume discount logic.
