# SKU Catalog Structure for BrightMove

## Overview
A well-structured SKU catalog enables flexible pricing, clear invoicing, and margin tracking. Use the Back Office module to organize all products and services.

## SKU Taxonomy
- **Class:** Major product group (e.g., ATS, Add-Ons, Usage-Based)
- **Family:** Sub-group (e.g., SMS, AI, Job Sponsorships)
- **Variant:** Specific product (e.g., 1,000 SMS batch, 10,000 AI tokens)
- **Pay Plan:** Invoicing terms (monthly, annual, prepaid, overage)

## SKU Examples
- ATS-USER-MONTHLY
- ATS-EMPLOYEE-ANNUAL
- ADDON-BRIGHTFORMS-UNLIMITED
- USAGE-SMS-1000
- USAGE-SMS-OVERAGE
- USAGE-AI-10000
- USAGE-AI-OVERAGE
- USAGE-JOBSPONSOR-10
- USAGE-JOBSPONSOR-OVERAGE
- PROSERV-DATACONV
- PROSERV-TRAINING
- PROSERV-IMPLEMENTATION
- PARTNER-ATS-USER-MONTHLY

## Best Practices

- Automate SKU assignment in billing and invoicing
- Integrate with QuickBooks for financial tracking
- Use SKU prefixes (e.g., PARTNER-) to distinguish partner/white label products from retail.
